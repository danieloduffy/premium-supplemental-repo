# General Advice for Premium Learners

This folder contains a reading list with the most broadly applicable and high-impact advice for all learners in Premium.  Your mentors will have personal advice for you, but it will help for you to know the general wisdom too.

These resources can be consumed in any order, but we recommend reading these guides in ascending numerical order from `00` onwards.
