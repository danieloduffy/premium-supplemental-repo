# Getting Unstuck With your Code - Part Three: Premium

If you've read the [other](https://github.com/codecademy-coaches/premium-supplemental-repo/blob/master/general-advice/05-getting-unstuck-part-one.md) [two](https://github.com/codecademy-coaches/premium-supplemental-repo/blob/master/general-advice/06-getting-unstuck-part-two.md) entries in our series on getting unstuck and you're [familiar with Slack](https://github.com/codecademy-coaches/premium-supplemental-repo/blob/master/general-advice/07-how-to-use-slack.md), then you're ready to learn how to make the most of the resources available to you in Premium!

Within Premium you have three methods of support:

1. Your peers
2. The office hours hosts
3. Your mentor

Luckily, the first two are found in the same place – Slack!

## Slack

In orientation to Premium you will have heard about office hours being held in Slack, but Slack is a much more powerful tool than that.  Not only do you not need to turn up live to office hours to get help (the hosts will answer questions that were asked before they went online), but Premium is a global program so there's _someone_ online at any hour of the day.

If, after following the steps we covered in parts one and two of this series, you're still stuck, head to Slack.  **Don't save all your questions for your mentor! **

### #Online-Now

The main help channel in Slack is named #online-now for a reason: post in there to reach other people who are online at that moment!  You can post in there even if you don't need "help," maybe you're coding late at night and want some company, it's up to you.

### #Standup

You may not think of our standup ritual as a "support system," but it is designed for that purpose.  With standups you hold yourself accountable to your own ambitions, share your struggles, and applaud others on their work (they'll clap for you too!).  We run community standup every Tuesday, but real-world technical teams run standup daily.  The number one reason why people don't reach their goals with learning to code is "life getting in the way."  Unless something truly transformative happens, you can find time if you make time.

### #Pair-Programming (and Code Buddies)

Pair-programming is a tried and true method of making progress with difficult coding problems, give it a go!  Traditionally people will work in a duo, but you can work in larger groups if you wish.  You can work on your personal projects when pairing, but just be sure that all members of the group are benefiting from the experience – if you get help on your personal work, help your pair with their project too.  Join the channel to take part, and read [our guide](https://github.com/codecademy-coaches/premium-supplemental-repo/blob/master/group-coding-how-to/pair-programming-guide.md) for info on how to do so.

An underrated thing to come out of pair-programming is simply in making a face-to-face connection to someone else in the program making a similar journey.  Why not continue that connection beyond your pair-programming and make them your (don't laugh) [accountabilibuddy](http://forgingleaders.com/why-you-need-an-accountabilibuddy-and-how-to-find-one/)?  Even something as simple as agreeing to hop online at the same time and work for a set period of time can make a huge difference.  We're big fans of the principles of [FocusMate](https://www.focusmate.com/), and the [science](https://www.focusmate.com/science) that backs it up, and you can bring that same experience to Premium.  If you're learning to code full-time, this is even more important as that experience is quite lonely, but it doesn't have to be.

**You aren't in this alone.**

### Code Review

You may be digging yourself into a hole and not even realize it, or you've missed a way that you can do something better.  Share your work for review, and pay it forward by giving a review too.  Reviewing code and handling code reviews are key skills for professional developers, who usually can't make a change to the code base without a peer review.  Learn how to go about code reviews with [our guide](https://github.com/codecademy-coaches/premium-supplemental-repo/blob/master/group-coding-how-to/code-review-guide.md) and when you're ready share your code with your friends in the program, or just throw it in #online-now (be brave!).

### Go Local

If you're in a major metro area, there's probably someone else in Premium nearby.  Even if you're not, there's usually someone in the same state, country, or almost certainly your time zone.  Find those people (browse #introductions or simply post in #online-now to ask).  You can head to meetups together, share your networks, pair program, and more.  Feel free to make a private channel whenever you have a group (whether a set of people in the same city or any other reason) as that's a lot easier to manage than DMs.

### Wherever You Go, Be a Good Citizen

_Always make yourself easy to help_. On Slack, use threads, formatting, and links together to provide all the appropriate context without disrupting conversations.

The same principles apply outside of Slack, remain mindful of our earlier [advice](https://github.com/codecademy-coaches/premium-supplemental-repo/blob/master/general-advice/05-getting-unstuck-part-one.md) on how to get unstuck (and get help) and don't take up [too much oxygen](https://i.imgur.com/rfKUxRW.png) with your issues.

## Your Mentor

All of the things that we noted above can be applied in your mentor sessions.  You can start your session with catching your mentor up on your progress and difficulties, and then wrap up the session discussing what you'll get done before the next session.  Having your sessions (roughly) once a week at a regular day and time will further provide structure, and you'll naturally want to do better knowing that you'll talk with your mentor soon.  Even if you don't feel like you have much to discuss, you do, and that's because **mentor sessions aren't just for getting help**.  If you're doing things right, you shouldn't have many questions for your mentor anyway as you'd have used Slack for that.  Here's a checklist of things you can do with your mentor time:

* Live code review (this is usually the best thing to do with your time)
* Pair-program
* Test yourself with being _conversant_ with code
* Delve deeper into topics
* Prepare for upcoming problems you don't know about yet
* Check that you are ready to move on from a topic (even if you feel you're okay, you may not be)
* Plan what to do with your personal project
* Hear whether or not you should skip upcoming optional content, take a branch off the common core path, skip ahead, double back on things you left earlier, and more – your mentor is your guide through the Premium program!

The principles of being a good citizen and being easy to help still apply here – always fill out your learner journal in your shared repo before your 1-on-1.

## That's All, Folks!
