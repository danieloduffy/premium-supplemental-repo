# Leveling Up: From Beginner to Intermediate Programming

When you first begin to study coding and programming, it’s pretty easy to determine your own proficiency - you don’t have any yet! As you amass knowledge about writing code, breaking down problems, and looking for answers, you will start to better understand the landscape of coding. You’ll be ready to apply what you have learned through Codecademy’s tutorials and other resources to a new project, and may feel as though you have hit a wall. This is totally normal, and is something that almost all coding students experience. You’ve now moved into Phase 2 of [the Thinkful article](https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/) to which we refer often (it's really good and we wish we wrote it, also ignore the "you should enroll at Thinkful" parts 😉). You should review the sections on “Resource Density” and “Scope of Knowledge.” 

Evaluating where you fall on this spectrum is murky, as there are no clear industry standards of what constitutes beginner, intermediate, and expert level programming. One popular, but by no means definitive, approach to the levels of programming can be found in this [programmer competency matrix](http://sijinjoseph.com/programmer-competency-matrix/).

So how do you get from your definition of beginner to intermediate? Admittedly, this does depend a great deal on which programming language you are studying and what your ultimate goal is. For example, reddit user @DrJohnFever provided a Python example in [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5adn3k/what_is_considered_beginner_intermediate_expert/). 


>For example, with Python:
>* A beginner has to look up if statements to see whether it's if or elif. They still don't know what the "self" argument for functions in a class is used for. They frequently put "if arr != []" to check for an empty array.
>* An intermediate knows how to use Python. They still occasionally forget some of the basic things (like how to open a file, or how to iterate through a dictionary), but a quick Google search will almost always fix their problem. They can write and read programs in Python just fine.
>* An expert understands Python to a C implementation level (talking about CPython right now, not any of the other implementations). They can tell you how the yield function works, what the GIL is, and always seem to know every trick up Python's sleeves. They can describe how the #include statement runs, and have snooped through the implementation of a standard library module on more than one occasion.

In case you’re not studying Python (or even if you are), this article does a pretty good job of providing general advice on how to level up your ability: 

* **Article:** [10 Tips To Go From A Beginner to Intermediate Developer](https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/software-engineer/10-tips-to-go-from-a-beginner-to-an-intermediate-developer/)

This article has several bits of helpful advice that many intermediate programmers have followed. Note this one in particular: it’s a good idea to pick a topic that most closely relates to the type of work you would like to be doing and read as much as you can about it. Is it database design? E-commerce transactions? *Mastering one skill* will give you the confidence to master related skills as well. 

[This post](https://medium.com/@Charles_Stover/become-the-junior-developer-that-companies-want-to-hire-c539f4c236d8) is also chock-full of excellent advice even if it is aimed in particular at people wanting to become developers (and if that's you, you'll like the post even more).

We’ll outline a few more general tips below:

## Teaching others
One of the best ways to evaluate how well you know how to do anything is to teach someone else how to do it. Fortunately, the Codecademy community and online developer forums provide ample opportunities for you to do this. Are there new students that you can help through something you’ve already learned? Are there questions on Stack Overflow that you now know how to answer? Contribute! This will both reaffirm what you have already learned and help you practice your new skills, the mastery of which will help you progress as a programmer. 


## Apply your knowledge to projects outside of your tutorials
Now’s the time to start using some of those skills to build something without the framework of the tutorial, and ideally without copying blocks of code. Pick something small (you can look at our post on how to pick a coding project [here](https://github.com/codecademy-coaches/premium-supplemental-repo/blob/master/getting-a-developer-job/03-picking-a-coding-project.md)) and start to work on building it. Alternatively, you can contribute to existing open source projects that use the language or skills you have acquired - Python, CSS, etc. 

You can also avail yourself of the number of opportunities that Codecademy Premium provides for [pair programming](https://github.com/codecademy-coaches/premium-supplemental-repo/blob/master/group-coding-how-to/pair-programming-guide.md) with mentors or others in the community. In short, you don’t have to do this part alone!

## Challenge yourself
Something you can work on in your own time are coding challenges. These are a popular way to test and level up your coding ability, as well as to see how others attack the same problem. You can find daily coding challenges [in the r/dailyprogrammer community](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/), and twelve additional ones [at Codecondo](https://codecondo.com/coding-challenges/). In Premium we've also sprinkled in challenges from the likes of [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) throughout your journey, but you need not be limited to those.


## In conclusion
Moving past the beginner phase of your educational journey will be challenging and exciting. We want you to use as many of the Codecademy Premium resources that you can to prepare yourself to work on great projects and eventually advance to expert/ninja status. With these general principles in mind, as well as the perseverance that we tout in almost every part of the repo, you’ll make it through this cliffs of confusion and keep building great things.
