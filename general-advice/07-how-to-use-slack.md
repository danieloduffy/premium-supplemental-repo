# How to Use Slack

You've probably used Slack at work already - it's nearly ubiquitous at tech companies and with many communities using their free version (like us in Premium!). Whether you have or not, it's a vital tool to get right and use well for the Premium program and beyond, whether you aim to be on a tech team or lead one.  Generalizing here, but developers love Slack, hate other messaging platforms, and have mixed feelings about email, which is the strongest element behind its meteoric growth. Get used to Slack and see why.

In this guide we'll presume that you've already signed up for the Premium Slack as part of the program onboarding.  Maybe you've made a rookie mistake by [not using it since signing up](https://media1.tenor.com/images/06f9feb4240ba68ecd322a655d5443b8/tenor.gif?itemid=14973533), but don't worry we forgive you and this can be a fresh start. Remember that using Slack well is a group effort, and that if we all do the right thing we'll all benefit.

Let's start with **orientation**.  When you start Slack you'll see something like the following.

The how-to guide here applies to any Slack workspace (which you can think of as a "room"), we have a [separate post](https://github.com/codecademy-coaches/premium-supplemental-repo/blob/master/general-advice/08-getting-unstuck-part-three.md) on how to get the most out of the Premium Slack space.

## The App

Key before you get too deep is that, unlike a lot of apps these days, Slack is best used as a native application and not in your browser. In fact the browser version kinda sucks and in the workplace the only people who ever use it are HR teams removing ex-employees.  Don't waste any more time, download the app.

## Channels

Conversations in Slack are grouped by topic into _channels_, like #online-now and #pair-programming. You can think of them like groups on Facebook. Channels do look deceptively like normal continuous chat services, like WhatsApp or Messenger, but each message in the channel can be responded to individually by using _threads_. It's a little like replying to a specific message in WhatsApp, but the reply is hidden from the chat log.
You can start a thread from the menu that appears when you over an individual message, it's the chat bubble icon.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xPvECck.png" alt="Slack response menu" width="200" height="whatever">

> There are some other cool options in this menu, try them out!  Also look in the ellipsis `â€¦` menu for setting reminders and beyond, [check them out](https://i.imgur.com/4pdvPmL.png) on your own time.

When you click the thread button, you'll be able to type your message in the sidebar.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/sktAABU.png" alt="threads" width="400">

The big benefit of using threads is that it keeps the channel focused. People can scan the channel for new questions and only read further and reply to the messages that are relevant to them.  You can easily access a thread once started by clicking on "replies" under the post where there's some profile pictures from people who are participating in the thread.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qP65oZE.png" alt="thread example" width="600">

Imagine if all fifteen threadeed replies there were in the main feed, it'd _dominate_ the conversation! ðŸ™€

**You should thus use threads as often as possible within the Premium community**!

The drawback of using threads is that if something very important is said in the thread, the rest of the channel won't see it, but do not fret: there's a check box option to "also send to #{channel}" when composing the thread message. Please use this option sparingly, when you are certain _everyone's_ gonna want to read your reply.

## "Unread" Messages and Where to Communicate

Another difference with Slack versus other messaging systems is in how other users are alerted about new messages. By default, _every new message in a channel will be marked as an unread message_. However, with threads, only people who have been active in or following them get notified of unread messages therein. Basically, keeping to threads keeps your co-slackers from being overwhelmed by new message notifications for things that don't apply to them.

Unread messages and notifications are another reason why you shouldn't think of Slack as just another instant messaging system, and why you should think of the channels as more of a newsfeed. If you were posting on Facebook, you should have a good reason why you'd split one thing into multiple posts.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/18tytSQ.png" alt="bad message hygiene" width="200">

Tagging someone else in the program with `@username` is a potentially helpful way to make sure that a specific other person sees your message.

<img src="https://sdhunt.github.io/codecademy-ref/mod/img/slack/at-mention.png" alt="@ mentions" width="600">

There are also options with Slack to tag everyone currently active `@here` or everyone in a channel active or not `@channel` and even everyone in the workspace `@everyone` but in Premium these have been limited to admin use only.

### Private Channels and/or DMs

In the Premium workspace the only people who can make new public channels are admins (so that things don't get so cluttered) but you can start your own private channel from the `+`  icon to the right of "Channels" in the sidebar.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LrknnCp.png" alt="new channel button" width="200">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MQNOgKJ.png" alt="new channel options" width="400">

Private channels are great for group conversations.  You can also send DMs to multiple people at once, but private channels are better for keeping topics clear and distinct, and allowing others to join upon invitation later.  For example, you may want to have a private channel for people in your metro area so you can go to meetups or pair-program together in-person.  To start DMs with people (including multiple folks at once) click the `+` icon to the right of "Direct Messages" in the sidebar, just like with channels.  You can also convert DMs to private channels or add people to channels using the gear icon to the left of "search" in the top nav, but we'll explore that menu later.


## Formatting & Etiquette

When formatting is done badly (or not done) in Slack, the outcome can be ugly, illegible, and even downright rude.  I don't want to trigger anyone, so click these links to see [good](https://i.imgur.com/OKNRXqK.png), [bad](https://i.imgur.com/amt7pNY.png), and [worse](https://i.imgur.com/UrRYz7n.png) examples for sharing code.  Gross!

Luckily for you, you'll already be learning Markdown in Premium in order to use GitHub (this guide was written in Markdown!) and Slack uses very similar syntax for formatting.

<img src="https://sdhunt.github.io/codecademy-ref/mod/img/slack/format-input.png" alt="formatting" width="600">

When you send that, it will render as follows.

<img src="https://sdhunt.github.io/codecademy-ref/mod/img/slack/format-result.png" alt="alt text" width="600">

If you have a longer piece of code to post, add it as a snippet - you can even add appropriate formatting!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VvQHs3D.png" alt="new channel options" width="400">

Like threads, this will help to keep the channel from getting cluttered and noisy.  Always be mindful of your peers in the program and being a good citizen!


## Configuring Notifications & Cutting Noise

Reading all the above, you can see that there's a lot of ways to get messages, and it's true that this can get overwhelming, particularly as more and more people join Premium and have conversations. The best way to keep the space and chats clean and manageable is for us all to follow the best practices mentioned here and in our post on **how to get help within Premium**, like using threads, but even then it's good to know your options.

### Do Not Disturb Mode

If you don't want to shut down Slack notifications more permanently but just want some time without distractions, set yourself to "do not disturb" with the bell icon next to your name or with a slash command of `/dnd` (for more cool slash commands, see our links at the end of the article).

<img src="https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115014884406/REDUCE_NOISE_0_tip_dnd__1_.png" alt="snooze notifications" width="450">

### Status and Availability

To the left of the bell icon you've got a drop-down menu with the workspace name. From there, you can change your status to something custom or merely to "away."

<img src="https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360003833667/status.png" alt="set status" width="300">

Slack will also consider you away after 30 minute of inactivity, and by default it will then send notifications to your mobile device instead.  You can configure that with the instructions below.

### The Mute Button

Turn a channel from something you get notified about to something you can choose to check in on (or not) with the mute button.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dSZ7KPK.png" alt="mute mode" width="700">

Think of this like setting up an auto-archive filter for certain email messages or having a separate email folder for promotions. If you mute a channel, you'll still have access to the messages in it, but you won't get notifications or indications about what if anything is being discussed there nor until you go and check.

### Pro Moves: Fine-Tuned Notifications

You may have seen in the above screenshot an option for "notification preferences" in the gear icon's menu above "mute." Click that and you'll be able to set your notification preferences for that channel.  Only want to see the _most important_ admin broadcasts or things directly addressed to you in that channel? You have that option.  By opening up the Slack app on your mobile devices you can also set mobile notifications differently for the same channels.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3CuhZxx.png" alt="notification config" width="220">



Unlike muting a channel, you'll still be able to see when there are updates in a channel, you just won't get actively pinged about them.

### Global Notifications

The eagle-eyed among you saw a note in the screenshot above to change workspace-wide notifications from the preferences menu.  You can access that with the hotkey `âŒ˜,` on Mac or from the drop-down menu with the workspace name.

<img src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_5c3f89b454b4d.png" alt="access preferences" width="500">

Then on the notifications page, you have some options.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lQXWkSx.png" alt="notifications preferences" width="600">

We'd recommend the second option on the list, for "direct messages, mentions & keywords."  That way is someone `@` tags or DMs you, or if a keyword you set is used then you'll get a push notification.  You should also get notified about replies in threads, and consider using different settings on mobile.

A bit further down we have two highly recommended options for peace of mind.  Set your sleeping and relaxing hours to do not disturb, and turn off the Slack sounds before they drive you nuts.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/n8WT21Y.png" alt="do not disturb and sound options" width="450">

Finally, you can also have different settings when you're "away" and sending updates to your mobile, and some people really like email updates.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/C09qooT.png" alt="inactive notification settins" width="450">

### The Nuclear Option: Leaving a Channel

If you're just done with a channel, we won't take it personally, you can leave easily and won't receive messages or notifications from it again unless you choose to rejoin.

<img src="https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115011652206/reduce_noise_in_slack_-_leave.png" alt="leave channel" width="550">

â€¦ but don't leave the cats.  They're good for mental health.
