# Getting Unstuck With Your Code - Part One

Whether you are stuck on a problem that you cannot yet solve in your coding lessons or are a working programmer who encounters a code roadblock as part of your job, you’re likely going to regularly need to try to get unstuck, and indeed ask for help.
 
The first thing to remember is that *everyone* gets stuck and needs to look things up. Learning is an ongoing, lifelong process, and programming is not a finite skill that one learns and then knows forever. On the contrary, the sheer amount of information involved in programming means that even developers with thirty years’ experience will consult online resources and other developers every day. Do not be discouraged or put off by getting stuck. If anything, getting past these blocks helps you refine your problem-solving skills and persistence, which are both important parts of the [programmer mindset](https://github.com/codecademy-coaches/premium-supplemental-repo/blob/master/general-advice/04-thinking-like-a-programmer.md). Making mistakes is a part of learning! 
 
The second thing to remember - and what we will tackle in this first post on getting unstuck - is that how you ask for help is as important as where you go or who you ask for help. Understanding your question and framing it in a clear way are both integral parts of finding the answer – not just for getting help but in helping yourself.
 
## Understanding the question
Before you ask for help, you should make your best efforts to understand where you went wrong and if the problem is something discrete and fixable by yourself. Resist the impulse that some learners have to hit a roadblock and immediately ask for help. Be persistent, and take another look at it to see if you can glean more information about what went wrong.
 
For example - is there a typo in the code that you can easily fix yourself? Are there notes in the error message that give you a clue as to where the error is? (Most Codecademy modules offer guidance in this way, especially on beginner lessons). For more on those first steps, particularly as they relate to Codecademy modules, check out this video:

Developer documentation should also be one of the first places you turn to for help.

### Isolating Problems

Maybe your initial steps and "tricks" for getting unstuck haven't worked, and you need to take this further. In this case, many methods to prepare your problem for another programmer's analysis just so happen to also be ways to troubleshoot.  That is, if you _isolate_ your problem so that it can be better understood by someone else, you'll likely understand it better.  One method is with a reduced test case.

Another approach to asking good questions is to frame it as a Short, Self-Contained, Correct (Compilable) Example, also known as a SSCE.

As part of how Codecademy Premium works, your code is already likely to be in GitHub, which is designed to accommodate collaborative coding, but sending someone an entire repo to look at can be a bit much.  Slimming it down, perhaps into something that you can share on the likes of [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) or [Repl](https://repl.it/) will help you and your peers see the wood from the trees.

### Code Errors and Debugging

We know it's frustrating when a whole lot of red text pops up telling you that you're making mistakes, but don't take it to heart.  Good programmers don't avoid errors and bugs altogether, in fact they encounter far more errors as they get more experienced and tackle harder problems - errors mean you're trying something cool, and often something new for you, both of which are to be desired.  Check out this totally made up graph below:

The error messages aren't a slap on the wrist from the computer, they're an outstretched helping hand for you to break through a deadlock.  Learn to love the color red!

It's hard to find language or platform-agnostic resources on how to go about debugging, but though many of the below resources use examples in languages with which you may be less familiar (like .NET, JavaScript, or Python), if you are comfortable with core programming principles (like loops) you should be able to get the gist and extrapolate to your chosen language / stack.

## Framing the question/how to ask for help
Now that you have done your best to understand your own question, you are in a better position to ask it in a way that dramatically increases the quality of the answers you get! 
 
Avoid the common misstep of just taking a screenshot of your code (or worse, taking a photo with your phone!) and posting it or sharing it without context. How you ask your question makes such a difference in how much other people can help you. The more specific and clear you are, the more someone else can help. The developer community is a generous one, but also an efficient one, so the *easier* you make it for someone to answer your question, the more likely you are to get a response. (Being polite always helps too!)

Take a look at this excellent article on how to frame coding questions (the whole piece is a good read, and the section entitled “Structure of a Great Question” is particularly relevant here):
 
* **Article:** [How To Ask Good Coding Questions](https://zellwk.com/blog/asking-questions/)
 
It also provides a great breakdown of the common beginners' mistakes with asking questions and specific advice on how to avoid those bad habits. The tone of this article is very much in the voice of an experienced programmer who would very much like to help other people get unstuck and wants to help them help themselves in getting help. It provides a lucid, step-by-step guide on how to look at your question and prepare it to be asked in a way that maximizes the chance of a good response from whoever you are asking. If you read one thing or take away one lesson from this entry of the supplemental repo, make it this one!
 
## To be continued
In the second part of our three-part section on getting help, we will address where in the wide world of the Internet to look for answers, and how to interact with the developer community. After that in part three, we'll give some more precise advice on how best to get help within Codecademy Premium and make the most of your time here.
