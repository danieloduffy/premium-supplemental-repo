# Becoming a Good Programmer

You’re focused on gaining programming skills, but what about being *good* at it? 

“Good” is obviously a subjective term, but we can look to the testimony of experienced and successful developers to identify some common traits and suggestions.

## Theory
Before long, even within this program let alone in the world beyond, you'll be working on an avalanche of to-dos with your coding. From week to week and sprint to sprint, you’ll be laser-focused on the tasks in front of you, so it’s easy to lose sight of the more theoretical concepts that underpin the best programmers’ work.

There’s one thing all good programmers have in common—when trying to solve a problem, they expect to spend way more time trying wrong solutions than they spend finding the right one.

You’ve no doubt come across plenty of error messages to this point in your journey. They’re not going away any time soon, so we’re here to help you start looking forward to them.

## Process
Once you’ve learned to embrace errors and the messages that accompany them, you can confidently devise a process for working through both one-off problems and challenges that work on a larger scale.

## Communication
The ideas conveyed by your code are only a small percentage of the communicating you’ll have to do in a typical day working with developers or as a developer. As a member of a team, the way you communicate and interact with your teammates is just as important as any contributions to the codebase or wisdom you may provide.

That includes reading and providing feedback on others’ code, making your own code exceptionally readable, and knowing how to solicit good feedback.

There are many more intricacies to development team dynamics here, but the resources that you'll need depend on your objective.  No matter your goals, you will definitely need to know the above on how to communicate about coding at least in order to work well with your mentor!

## In conclusion
As a developer, learning never really stops. You might become the best JavaScript expert around, but one day you’ll look up and realize that what you learned once doesn't work anymore, that there's new nuances or versions to the language you picked up or totally new systems are being used.

That’s why being a good developer means not only learning the technical ins and outs, but also the more intangible skills that will translate to any language or framework. If you can communicate well with your teammates, write clean and scalable code, and approach problems with confidence and clarity, you'll be a step ahead of most.
