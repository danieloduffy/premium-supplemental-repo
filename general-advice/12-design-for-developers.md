# Design for Developers
Evolved humans know that in life, looks should not matter. What’s important is on the inside. Web and app developers know that when it comes to tech products and services, looks do matter. Good design of your website or app is the first step to drawing in users; bad or counterintuitive design can drive them away before they really give your project a chance. Since you’re already learning the substance - code - now might be a good time to learn a little bit about the form as well. 
 
We’re not here to teach you how to be a designer when what you’re really trying to do is build your development skills. However, it will be very beneficial to you as a coder to have an elementary grasp of basic design principles, a list of sources of design templates to start you off, and a little advice on how to best communicate with a designer should you end up working with one. 
 
 
## Some basic principles of design 
The cornerstones of design, as they apply to you, are: color palette, font, icon design and placement, and visual style. Most design tutorials and tools focus on one or more of these. If you’re building a website or app, you’ve probably thought about and/or made some decisions about color, font, and icon design already. Most likely you’ve mimicked the color scheme, font style, and icons of a website or app that you already really like. Understanding why you liked those colors together, or what impression you got about the product from the typeface and icon style, is a really interesting topic to explore at a high level. As I like to say, design talks. It expresses ideas to your user beyond what’s actually written in your text. So it’s best to at least be conversational in its language. 
 
Start with this video:
 
* **Video:** [5 quick tips for non-designers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJJlxdqg1Dc)
 
If you review nothing else in this article, this short (only two and a half minute long) video gives you a cheat sheet to those cornerstones that I mentioned above. It’s a quick and helpful tour of how to think about the basic design elements of a website and, more importantly, what those design elements communicate to your user.
 
If you don’t want to stop there (hooray!) and would like to dig a *little* deeper into design principles, check out the video below on color psychology: 
 
* **Video:** [Marketing Color Psychology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0smq5ljlf4)
 
Oh man, I’m so glad you didn’t stop at that first video, because color psychology is quite fascinating and this video covers a lot of it in only fifteen minutes. It takes you through color psychology and several examples of movie posters, magazine covers, etc. to walk through how colors are used together and what makes certain color combinations powerful, weak, or overwhelming. They also walk you through each color and which shades of say, orange, have the best effect on the viewer. Visme, the company that made it, has several good videos on visuals, so you may want to click around in there. **However, if going too deep into color theory feels overwhelming, this one is a good primer and you can move on.** It just helps to have seen the basics covered.  
 
* **Video:** [Design for Non-Designers](https://youtu.be/MwbZiGd0gco)
 
So many videos! Tracy Osborn, who conducts the talk in this video, has given this presentation at several events and conferences, and it’s no wonder that she’s asked to present on this over and over. Her 38 minute talk takes you through the concepts covered above and applies them to web and app design. It’s a detailed, thoughtful take on design in tech, and one worth checking out for sure. This one has more content on icon placement and UX, which will help you build a significantly better-designed app or website.  
 
Finally, if you really want to get in there, like, GOOGLE level get in there, watch [this presentation on Mobile App Design Principles from the 2016 Google IO conference](https://youtu.be/u7iUoxqKaKU?t=750). That link skips ahead to the 12:30 mark, where the principles start, but the whole talk is pretty comprehensive.
 
Tired of videos? No worries. Here is a clear, concise post on **developing a design sense** from [Paul Copplestone.](https://paul.copplest.one/blog/design.html#building-a-design-y-sense) You can really tell that this one was written by a developer, not a designer, because there are no pretty colors or images. Just words. Ah, words. Like I said, clear and direct. 
 
## Design templates 
Yes, this is what you were looking for. A template! Now you know why this wasn’t the first section. I wanted you to learn a *little* about design first (all of those videos together are shorter than a movie so it’s totally doable). There are several sources of templates online, of varying styles, quality, and price. Here are a few to kick off your search:
 
* [Webflow](https://webflow.com/free-website-templates). Bonus, it’s free!
* [Freebiesbug](https://freebiesbug.com/psd-freebies/website-template/). As the name suggests, free.
* [Skillcrush](https://skillcrush.com/blog/free-portfolio-templates/). Pretty basic, but also free.
* [3rd Wave Media](https://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/) UX-Centered themes and templates. 
* [Colorlib](https://colorlib.com/wp/designer-website-templates/) Website design templates. 
* [W3.CSS Web Design Templates](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_templates.asp)
* [This repository of templates for purchase](https://themeforest.net/search/portfolio%20developer)
 
Once you browse through those and get a sense of what you like and don’t like for your current project, you can do a more detailed search for those themes or keywords. If you’re building a web design portfolio site, take a look at how [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43cusmuLFMw) approached building his. 
 
## Communicating with designers
You’ve hired a designer to do the design part for you! Or you have a job (congrats) that requires you to work with designers. Great! Now you need to figure out how to talk to them.
 
The “language barrier” between developers and designers sounds like a joke, but as you’ve probably learned in your studies and work so far, different teams do communicate with their own lingo and assumptions. In the same way that you may become frustrated with a non-technical person telling you how your app or website should work, you may find yourself having difficulty communicating what you want from a designer that you hire or work with. Not to worry. The articles and links below outline a few different strategies for making sure that you and your designer are on the same (landing) page. Did you laugh at our little joke? We did. 
 
* **Article:** [How to Talk to Designers About Design](https://www.netguru.com/blog/talking-designers-about-design)
 
The author of this article has, as he puts it, “been on both sides of the divide.” It’s a clear and forthright look at communication with designers (who may have their own difficulty expressing their thoughts) and suggests a few strategies that you will see pop up again in the articles below. Which is a good thing, that means they work!
 
* **Article:** [4 Tips to Improve Communication Between Designers and Developers](https://www.secretstache.com/blog/improve-communication-designers-developers/)
 
As the title states, this is a quick look at developer-designer communication from a high level. It includes both broader tactics, like empathy, and some practical suggestions on working well together. 
 
* **Article:** [How to Communicate With Your Graphic Designer](https://designpickle.com/how-to-communicate-with-your-graphic-designer)
 
This one is organized around the “Five Love Languages of a Graphic Designer.” If you’re familiar with the Five Love Languages, you’ll get a kick out of how the piece is organized, but even if you’re not, you’ll come away with some ideas of how to tailor your approach to what your designer likely needs. 
 
* **Article:** [11 Ways Clients can Communicate Better With Designers](https://www.creativebloq.com/business/communicate-better-designers-101413329)
 
This one, from a designer’s point of view, covers how different types of clients can better communicate with all types of designers - UX, web, graphic, etc. Again, you’ll see some repeats here, but it’s worthwhile to see what all of these articles say and try to implement those tactics. 
 
 
## In conclusion
With a baseline understanding of design, a few examples, and the tools to best communicate with designers, you’re well on your way to having your app be as beautiful on the outside as your code is on the inside!
