# Thinking Like A Programmer
During law school orientation, all students take a class with some iteration on the title “Thinking Like a Lawyer.” In some schools, this is a semester-long course. The idea behind this is that learning how to think like a lawyer - learning how lawyers look at fact patterns, how they take them apart, how analytical or creative or rhetorical or fact-minded they must be - makes it much easier for students to learn the sheer volume of rules and the applications of those rules once they start working. In this way, learning the mindset of a programmer can help you learn how to code and, more importantly, help you in the day to day work of being a programmer. Having the right mental approach to solving problems is crucial to making you a good programmer and to keep you from getting frustrated or giving up.
 
This mindset is comprised of two major concepts - algorithmic thinking and perseverance. 
 
## Algorithmic Thinking
Though algorithmic thinking is defined in different ways by different programmers, there are several core components of this mindset that appear in almost every definition. The generally accepted steps of algorithmic thinking are well laid out by Reddit user `sir_eeps` in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/4svm5v/how_can_i_begin_to_think_like_a_programmer/).  
 
```
Take a bigger idea / problem concept
Break it down into smaller bits
Then smaller bits
Then smaller bits
Then figure out what you need to do/know to solve that small bit
If you don't know it - learn it
Solve that bit
Then build it up to the next bit
Then figure out what you need to do/know to solve that small bit
If you don't know it - learn it
Solve that bit
Then build it up to the next bit
Rinse & repeat until you solved the initial problem
```

In short, algorithmic thinking involves breaking problems down to their most basic steps and addressing each small step in order to build back up to the initial problem, as opposed to taking a broad view to the entire problem. For further examples, take a look at the similarities in these three other descriptions of algorithmic thinking.

This video is a great overview of algorithmic thinking and how you can practice it with non-coding examples.

Here we see an extensive list of examples of algorithmic thinking, with a few different types of explanations, in case the first one didn’t resonate with you.  
 
Finally, if you’d like to delve more deeply into the programming mindset, you can read this book:

Widely considered to be one of the best books on the subject, _Think Like a Programmer_ runs at only 250 pages and is an excellent resource for beginners. Reading an entire book on the subject may seem daunting, and like it is a detour from your excitement to get starting coding, but this book may save you time in the long run!  Although those books use code examples in different programming languages, many of the underlying concepts are common across all programming languages.  Resources like _Think Like a Programmer_ will help you understand programmatic thinking and problem solving no matter what language is your primary for development. You could, for extra practice in problem solving, translate the code examples and ideas in Think Like a Programmer into JavaScript or whichever other language you prefer, and work them out.  For resources that more closely align with your chosen language, like [_You Don't Know JS_](http://youdontknowjs.com) talk to your mentor or ask your peers in Slack.
 
## Perseverance
As you learn more about algorithmic thinking (and how people talk about it), you will notice that all good programmers understand, and are comfortable with, spending exponentially more time being wrong about the solution to a coding problem than being right about what to do next. This feeling may be alien to you, or may be one that you do not enjoy yet, but it will become an important part of successfully learning how to program and how to be successful in your future work. Do not be discouraged! Accepting this as part of your work and persisting in your efforts to solve problems will take you far.

This article would have fit equally well in the first section of this post, but it’s included here because of the introductory section on persistence. It is not a coincidence that persistence is the first topic addressed here, and both Part 1 and Part 2 of Devero’s series on thinking like a programmer should be useful to you.

If you enjoy a slightly humorous take on the expected journey of learning to become a programmer, this article is for you. We include it here because it is a good look at what to expect as you learn to code, and how to keep perspective as you work through this process. It is linked and recommended in other modules of the supplemental repo but it is widely applicable to many subtopics within learning to code.
 
Perseverance is a crucial part of learning and of problem solving in general, and it is the key differentiator between high performers (regardless of IQ) and mid-level performers (even those with high IQs). Instead of suggesting you read all of Angela Duckworth’s best-selling book on the subject, here is a six minute clip of her TED talk on the subject to inspire you.

Programmers need grit and perseverance to become strong problem solvers, and to solve the same types of problems in many different scenarios. Adopting this part of the programmer mindset will have a powerful, positive effect on your learning process. 
 
## In conclusion
Preparing yourself to think like a programmer is an important part of your career journey. After all, it’s what you will be doing every day on the job, along with your technical skills. Think of the programmer mindset as the first tool in your toolkit, one that you can apply not only to programming, but also to many other situations in your life.
