# Computer Science Degrees and You
If you came to your coding journey without a formal background in computer science, you may be wondering what students with computer science (CS) degrees learned while in school, and how much of that material is pertinent to your current studies. In this article, we will look at the structure of a CS degree and the general topics that CS students learn.  
 
Generally speaking, a CS curriculum is an overview of the science of computing, and programming is taught as part of learning about topics such as operating systems, software development, algorithms, machine learning, etc. Coding programs like Premium train students for jobs in software development and the programming skills that are the core of that training.  
 
Another key difference is best encapsulated in this excerpt from [this Medium post on employer expectations.](https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/coding-bootcamps-vs-computer-science-degrees-what-employers-want-and-other-perspectives-4058a67e4f15)
 
>**The CS professors were primarily focused on teaching technical skills, and only some explicitly taught soft skills in CS courses**, though they sometimes teach soft skills implicitly through the organization of assignments and curriculum (e.g., teamwork, communication, the value of continued learning).... **[Coding school] instructors and administrators, on the other hand, focused strongly on certain soft skills in their courses, which they taught explicitly by mimicking real-life teams and projects where students focused directly on learning these skills along with the technical knowledge**. (boldface theirs) 
 
Thus, if you want to fill in any perceived gaps in your self-taught programming curriculum, you should first take a look at what CS students learn, review supplemental materials on those topics, and analyze how and when employers might require that knowledge. An advantage of having a CS degree is that your future employer can *safely assume* a certain base of knowledge that is regularly taught with CS degrees. Thus, if you can learn those topics and demonstrate your proficiency in them - concepts, jargon, skills - you put yourself in a similar category to those who have the degree, and can better communicate with team members who have CS degrees. 
 
Or, if you just want to learn more for fun, you can do that too!
 
## The CS syllabus and its Requirements	
To kick off, let’s review the subjects covered in a CS syllabus at a major university. You can find the course requirements for a CS major on many school websites. For our purposes today, let’s take a look at New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering. 
 
* **Article:** [Computer Science program at NYU Tandon](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/computer-science-bs)
 
This is an excellent resource that breaks down all of the topics of study required for a Bachelor of Science degree at a top university. Expand each section and take a look at the required computer science, mathematics, and engineering courses, as well as the potential electives. Then review the section entitled Sample Course Schedule, which outlines which courses CS majors will take each semester of study. Take note of all of the classes that comprise the degree - programming, problem solving, engineering, design, data structures, algorithms, computer architecture, data analysis, etc.  
 
If you’d like to poke around other school’s requirements for a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, you can also take a look at [Carnegie Mellon’s curriculum](https://csd.cmu.edu/academic/undergraduate/bachelors-curriculum-admitted-2018), [Rutgers University’s sample schedule and requirements](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/cs-degrees/b-s-degree/sample-bs-schedule), and the [the University of Virginia’s requirements](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science/bs-computer-science). 
 
## Teaching Yourself some CS
There are a couple of great resources out there for students or working professionals who would like to familiarize themselves with or bone up on concepts covered in a standard CS curriculum. Your self-guided studies are full of excellent material on coding languages, tools, and soft skills, but you may wish to learn more about, say, operating systems or algorithm design. You may be newly employed and want to advance your technical vocabulary on a topic that your new team will be working on (more on that below). Or you may have a CS degree and want to revisit topics you haven’t used at work in a while and relive your good old days. Who are we to stop you? 
 
* **Course:** [A Self-Learning, Modern Computer Science Curriculum](https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/)
 
Okay, full disclosure - I, the author of this repo post, do not have a CS degree. Shocker, right? That being said, in my many, many hours of research on CS degrees, I have found this to be the most comprehensive, academic, and accessible self-guided course in computer science. Its syllabus closely mirrors that of several of the courses covered in the university curricula above, and while it is not a *substitute* for a CS degree it is an impressive and exhaustive resource for students, with links to entire courses and homework exercises with answer keys. Feel free to skim through topics that interest your or really dig into a particular one. 
 
* **Course:** [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)
 
This course covers nine major subjects and includes video lectures and recommended books and textbooks for each module. Most of the videos are classroom lectures, which means they may not be as clear or easy to follow as the instructional videos we usually recommend to you, especially if you don’t watch them in order. It will make you feel as though you’re studying CS in college, though! It also includes links to several free books and materials that you can read/peruse at your own pace.  
 
* **Video Playlist:** [Crash Course Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo)
Speaking of clear and easy-to-follow videos, you should check out Crash Course! This PBS Digital series has an entire module on computer science, taught by the brilliant and engaging Carrie Anne Philbin. Crash Course is a broad approach to CS, and covers concepts like modern computing, operating systems, and artificial intelligence in a manner especially suited to beginners. The entire course is about 40 videos, and is fast paced and interesting enough that it never feels like a lecture. If the curricula above looked intimidating, start here. 
 
## What This Means for You in the Workplace
Employers have their own views about the differences between candidates who have CS degrees and self-taught programming candidates. Also, as you know, being a Codecademy student, a CS degree is not a necessity to get a great job as a programmer or developer. In other posts online and in this repo you will find dozens of articles like [this one](https://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/technology/blog/computer-science-skills/) about which CS skills employers are really looking for, and how to learn and cultivate them.
