# Software Development Methodologies
There is a lot of confusing and sometimes-contradictory messaging out there about software development methodologies and how teams use them. 
 
In this section, we’ll do a quick overview of a few methodologies and will take a closer look at Scrum and Kanban, which are often used by Agile teams.  Let’s kick off by looking at a few overview articles about several methodologies to familiarize ourselves with the landscape. 
 
* **Article:** [12 Best Software Methodologies With Pros and Cons](https://acodez.in/12-best-software-development-methodologies-pros-cons/)
 
* **Article:** [Top 6 Software Methodologies](https://leankit.com/blog/2019/03/top-6-software-development-methodologies/)
 
You’ll see a few methodologies repeat in those lists - namely Waterfall, Agile, and Lean. The Lean philosophy goes beyond programming and indeed has its [origins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing) at 1930s-era Toyota, prioritizing waste elimination and often focusing on one improvement at a time.  Lean, when applied to software development, will typically be grouped with Scrum and Kanban as variants of Agile. But before we get into subspecies, let’s look at Waterfall and Agile, the two most common development methodologies.
 
## Waterfall and Agile
The most traditional, “old school” software development methodology is called *Waterfall*. Waterfall’s Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is sequential, meaning that it is outlined at the beginning of the process and followed step by step. If something changes, the entire process starts again from the beginning. It moves through Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance phases, and stays in maintenance indefinitely. Many long-time and even some new programmers learn the Waterfall methodology first, as it is the basis from which other methodologies sprang. 
 
In contrast, Agile is iterative and allows for changes to be made during the development process without starting over. It is much easier to incorporate new requirements into an Agile workflow, which is a big part of its draw. You can find the impetus behind the principles of Agile in the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), which was drafted in 2001 by a group of seventeen developers.
 
When you begin working on a team with other developers, you are most likely going to use a Waterfall- or Agile-based approach.

* **Article:** [All You Need to Know About Software Methodologies](https://usersnap.com/blog/software-development-methodologies/) 
 
This could have gone in the first section, but I included it here to highlight the Waterfall versus Agile pros and cons (and you can peek ahead at Scrum and Kanban, which we will discuss more below).

Don’t worry too much about picking one of these methodologies just yet, especially since it will likely be picked by your organization or team lead (though we would typically recommend using Agile for your custom personal projects in Premium). The real benefit of this article is its explanation of both Waterfall and Agile so that you can be prepared to adapt to one later.
 
## Scrum and Kanban
Now that we’ve looked at Agile, we can take a deeper dive into two methodologies that fall within the world of Agile - Scrum and Kanban. You’ll likely hear these words a lot too, from developers and even from [hit HBO comedies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVksFviJVE)(warning: the language in that Silicon Valley clip is rated R, so proceed with maturity or parental consent). 
 
Here is [one explanation](https://www.cmswire.com/information-management/agile-vs-scrum-vs-kanban-weighing-the-differences/) of how Agile, Scrum, and Kanban are related: 
> "Agile is a set of guiding principles... Scrum and Kanban, on the other hand, are two methodologies that are considered to be Agile. Or to put it another way, if you want to work in an agile fashion, Scrum and Kanban are two ways to do it."
 
Note that you will see differing opinions on whether Kanban is a “methodology” or a “method” or something else entirely. For our purposes, this distinction is not important, so we’ll continue to call it a methodology from now on.  
 
### Scrum
[This Toptal post](https://www.toptal.com/project-managers/technical/agile-scrum-kanban-what-do-they-mean) is hands-down one of our favorite resources on this topic, especially in regards to laying out how Scrum works. 
 
> “Scrum consists of three roles: *Product Owner*, *Scrum Master*, and *Development Team*; four ceremonies: *Planning Meeting*, *Daily Scrum*, *Sprint Review*, and *Sprint Retrospective*; and three artifacts: *Product Backlog*, *Sprint Backlog*, and *Product Increment*. It is organized into regular time frames, which we call *sprints*. Sprints should last between one and four weeks.
 
The *Product Owner*, or PO, is responsible for guiding the project’s direction. As new tasks and features are determined, the PO adds them to the *Product Backlog*. A *sprint* starts with a *Planning Meeting* where the *Development Team* selects the tasks from the Product Backlog to work on and plans how they will be implemented. That is followed by development, during which the Dev Team uses the *Sprint Backlog* to track progress and meets for the *Daily Scrum* to synchronize activities and adjust the plan, if needed. The result of development should be a *Product Increment*, something that can be applied to the product and released immediately. At the end of the sprint, the Product Increment is presented to the Product Owner at the *Sprint Review*, where the product backlog is augmented if further changes are needed. Afterward, the whole team attends the *Sprint Retrospective* (also known as the Pub Meeting) where they talk about the work process and how it can be improved.”
To see a more thorough explanation, check out our video explaining what Scrum is and the following how-to video on implementation: 
 
* **Video:** [What is Scrum And How It Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNFIpNvyXPw)
 
* **Video:** [Scrum in Under 10 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU0llRltyFM)
 
The second video is less good as an overview than the first but makes up for it in practicality.
 
Two useful "artifacts" from Scrum that can help you with your work in Premium are user stories and sprints - watch the below to get some more detail on how to do so.

### Kanban
By now you’ve seen references to Kanban and how it works in the other resources listed here. Many Kanban resources are explained in contrast to Scrum, as are laid out in [this Atlassian post](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/kanban-vs-scrum)and [this Planview article](https://www.planview.com/resources/articles/kanban-vs-scrum/). That being said, it’s worthwhile to examine the way Kanban boards are set up on their own. 
 
* **Video:** [What is Kanban And How It Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhxncRy-_Rk)
 
* **Article:** [What is Kanban?](https://kanbanize.com/kanban-resources/getting-started/what-is-kanban/) 
 
The article should take about ten minutes to get through, and outlines the Kanban process, use of the board, resources, and tools in practical terms.
 
* **Video:** [What is Kanban?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVaFVa7HYj4)
 
The above video is part of an entire series dedicated to Kanban and Agile, so if you’re feeling like going down a YouTube rabbit hole on the subject, this is where you should start. Like the two Scrum videos above, you don't need the "rabbit hole" yet if you aren't looking to put this into practice.  Fun facts that you may encounter in your travels are that 1) the first Kanban-style system was used in the production of British World War Two Spitfire fighter planes and 2) like Lean, the Kanban system itself was formalized at Toyota in the late 1940s / early 1950s – modern business systems owe a lot to those pioneers!
 
Finally, it’s helpful to look through examples of Kanban boards to see how they are used on actual projects. You can find numerous examples [here](https://www.planview.com/resources/articles/kanban-board-examples/), including one specifically for developers.
 
## In conclusion … well, not really
This is by no means an exhaustive list of methodologies or of the ways in which you may end up using them. As you meet more experienced developers in the community, whether it's peers in Premium through Slack or your regular mentor check-ins, we suggest you ask them about which methodologies they like best and why, and for which purposes. As you continue to develop your skills with Codecademy Premium, you'll also have the opportunity to practice these methodologies in a group or team project, and you'll have some more in-depth guides in this repo's ["group coding" section](https://github.com/codecademy-coaches/premium-supplemental-repo/tree/master/group-coding-how-to) to help. Happy coding!
