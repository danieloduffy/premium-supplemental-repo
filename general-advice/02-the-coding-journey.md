# Charting the Winding, Coding Road Ahead of You

Since the day you started learning with Codecademy, you’ve probably noticed that we like to refer to the experience of learning to code as a journey. 

That’s because, like any other journey, there will be unexpected turns and changes of pace, and the person you are at the end of it will be very different than who you were when you started. 

## This is a _long_ journey
It’s reasonable for your total focus at this stage to be on landing that first job, launching your MVP idea, or whatever other goal you are aiming for. However, gaining development skills and coding projects make for a long and winding road.
Taken from someone who’s been in your shoes:

## Getting and staying motivated
If you’re reading this, you’re already pretty motivated to reach your goal with coding - after all you're investing a lot of time and money into it.

Keeping that motivation through the ups and downs of the learning process is a much tougher task. Don’t be too alarmed if you feel that motivation waning at times—you may need to remind yourself of why you started this journey in the first place.

## Dealing with adversity
Spoiler alert: the going gets tough.

Here are some of the more persistent challenges you can expect to face during your learning process and throughout your coding journey, plus actionable steps you can take to overcome them:

## Building good habits
The technical concepts you’re learning today will seem like child’s play before you know it, but the work habits you’re forming will stick with you. 

The articles below will help you make sure you’re forming the right ones.

## Be judicious with what you code

A common aphorism with development work is that the best programming work you can do is in _avoiding_ writing code (or alternatively, in the code that you _don't_ write).  That may sound weird, but bear with us. To illustrate this, consider the "10x rule of software development": that idea you spent 2 hours white-boarding can easily take 20+ hours to design and 200+ to code. This rule of thumb applies whether you can or can't design or code yourself.

![coding something takes 10x longer than designing it which takes 10x longer than fleshing out the idea](https://miro.medium.com/max/1926/1*g2l4Q7n3shpc3dp-92uKsQ.png "The Turtle.ai 10x Rule of Code")

Making good decisions about what to code, when, and how, is part of what distinguishes more senior developers from more junior ones. These decisions and thought processes ultimately save time, effort, and thus money. Don't just jump in to coding a solution or feature, think deeply about the methodology and reasons behind it, and if there's potentially a more efficient alternative.  For more on this mindset, see a [Medium post take on it](https://medium.com/@vlokshin/the-10x-rule-of-software-dev-f5122065bc76) as well as our sections on how developer teams are organized and work, particularly agile principles.

## In conclusion
You’re still near the beginning of a long and rewarding path. This is the time to be excited about the possibilities that lie ahead, and to start thinking through some of the challenges you can expect to face. 

With a clear understanding of your motivation for starting this process, good coding habits, and a willingness to face adversity head on, you’ll end up exactly where you want to be.
