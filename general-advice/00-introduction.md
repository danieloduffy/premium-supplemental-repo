# About this Guide

In this series of articles, we'll cover some essential material to help you to be a successful student with Premium. These resources are designed to be consumed alongside your technical journey with your personal repo and project. You can complete them at any pace you'd like, but we'd strongly suggest you finish them in your first two months. After all, you should know the context and best practices before you get too deep.

## The Resources & Recommendations

There are people all over the world with all sorts of goals and ambitions in Premium, from becoming a game developer to building a business MVP, so we've curated this list to be as concise and broadly applicable as possible.  Just like Premium curriculum content more broadly, we've pulled from the wider world of wisdom for this list, not just things on Codecademy.com.
