# Getting Unstuck With Your Code - Part Two
Welcome back to Getting Help! If you haven’t yet, please review [Part One](https://github.com/codecademy-coaches/premium-supplemental-repo/blob/master/general-advice/05-getting-unstuck-part-one.md) of this series on getting help, as it relays essential information about two crucial initial steps to getting help - understanding your problem, and framing it correctly. In this section, we will address the next two steps - how to ask good questions and give good answers.
 
Let’s dive right in. 
 
## Asking the question 
You have done your best to solve your problem yourself and have framed it in a clear, thorough way that will make it as straightforward as possible for someone to help you. The next step is to turn to Google or to a developer community for help.

### Searching for answers on Google
There are a few best practices for effectively finding answers on Google that we will outline below. 
 
* **Copy-paste your error message into the Google search bar.** If you’re a beginner, the error you have encountered has likely plagued many other beginners before you. Remember to remove project- or user-specific words from your error before searching.  If your question is more complicated, don’t be afraid to go a few pages into the Google results to find what you are looking for. 
* **Consider filtering results by recency.** Google’s search results do not take into account the importance of recency in these types of questions, so the first results are likely the most popular ones (which also tend to be from at least a few years ago). Be sure to factor in how long ago an answer or block of code was posted. A Quora user created a Chrome extension that helps toggle Google search by duration, and you can find it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-search-duration/gohmpbncdcmfmkoceccbdfmpjbbclnpg).
* **Work on becoming more specific in your query.** In discussions about how best to use Google for coding help, many programmers noted that their search queries became more specific and sophisticated as they learned more about coding. One even noted that he uses the specificity of his questions as a measure of how far he was coming along as a programmer. 
* **Make sure you know what kind of help Google is well-suited for.** Google often cannot tell you how to design a solution to your entire problem, but a search can help solve a specific part of your overall design. If you’re having trouble finding an answer, go back and ensure that your question cannot be broken down into smaller pieces. 
* **Use the solution as a learning opportunity.** Don’t Google a question, find an answer or block of code, copy-paste it into your work and move on. Take the time to learn about why this code or approach works, so that this answer is now in your mental toolbox when you work on different problems. Make sure you understand what that block of code does.

### Searching for answers in developer communities
Your Google search will likely lead you to a developer community or tool. If you haven’t yet found your answer, or feel that it is better suited to a person or group of people instead of Google, you can ask your question in these places: 
 
* [The Codecademy Forum](https://discuss.codecademy.com/) - the most obvious place!  This forum specializes with Codecademy content, both free and Pro, but is very welcoming (if we say so ourselves) for questions of any type.
* Reddit. The [Coding Help](https://www.reddit.com/r/CodingHelp/) subreddit and programmer community are very beginner-friendly, and include exhaustive FAQs. You may be quite familiar with Reddit and its structure already, which makes it an ideal place to start.  Just try to avoid the distractions of a detour into r/ProgrammerHumor.
* [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/ "StackOverflow"). It’s worth noting that StackOverflow does not represent itself as a help forum. Rather, SO is a repository of knowledge. This means that it is especially important to do your own homework before posting a question here, as the community members (who are generally on the more experienced side) really appreciate a well-framed question. It’s a great place to learn a lot about coding problems and a great community to join to help others. We will get back to that later! As on Reddit, questions are up- or downvoted on SO, so proper phrasing and active collaboration can drive a greater volume of answers.  
* [Quora](https://quora.com/ "Quora") is a gigantic community of question askers and responders, and requires an account to browse. The sheer volume of categories of questions can be a little intimidating, but you can find helpful answers in the “Learn to Program” and “Computer Programming” and “Software Engineer” communities. In fact, I used one of those forums to research this part of the repo! 
 
This is by no means an exhaustive list, and you may find links in these resources that lead you to other communities or forums that are very helpful. You can find a longer list in the article below.

Of course, as a member of Codecademy Premium you also have access to some dedicated help resources, but you can't rely on those alone... or if you did, it would be quite expensive over time, and we want to train you to be more self-sufficient!  As you learned in the previous entry in this series, using existing tools and resources are a great first step to take before asking for help.  In the next entry, we'll go through how to make the most of the help available to you in Premium.
 
## Giving back
All of these communities require membership for a reason - learning is about collaboration, not just consumption. Many others will help you on your coding journey, and you may be pleasantly surprised to see how many people you can help, even as a beginner! Actively participating in student and developer communities will benefit you in so many wonderful ways apart from just the technical aspect of learning. You’ll get help, give help, build personal and professional relationships, and remind yourself of how exciting learning a new skill can be. 

**When one teaches, two learn.**
