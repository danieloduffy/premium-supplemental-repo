The resources in this guide are not designed to be consumed in any particular order, but to be there for you when you need them in getting into the practicality of coding as part of a group.  For example, pair programming and team projects are both optional within Premium, and one could potentially do either before the other.  If you have the time, look through them and familiarize yourself with the subject matter even before it is time to take part.

*More units will come*, like how to work on a group or team project!
