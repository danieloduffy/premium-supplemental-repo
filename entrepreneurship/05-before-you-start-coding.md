# The Path to Launching Your MVP: Before You Start Coding

You’ve taken the steps to validate your idea through identifying your problem set, customer interviews and analyzing the results (yay!). Now you are ready to begin the next step in your journey, building your Prototype. A prototype is an early rudimentary version of your product. It is experimental, low-fi, cheap and fast. Building out a prototype allows you to do early user testing of your product and most importantly lets you find big issues with the build sooner rather than later. This will save you time on coding which is awesome! This doesn't mean you need to delay learning to code, as you'll want to have the skills to build your MVP by the time it comes to doing so.

Unlike the MVP, prototypes are not functional and really meant to show the concept of what you are building. Your prototypes will not be the final design for your MVP and will be really more for experimenting and testing purposes. We are going to walk through three different types of prototyping. The first two, do not involve coding and trust me, this will save you a ton of time for take you a long way when you do start to build. 

We will be focusing on the following three prototypes:  

* Paper
* Digital Mock Up
* Native 

### Prototyping -- Paper Prototyping

Paper prototyping is using paper to design an early version of product. Yup, paper. You do not need to be an artist to create design on paper. For those who are not artistically inclined, basic shapes (circles, stars, squares, etc) will be your friends :) when conveying your design. The benefits of paper prototyping are: 

* Accessibility
* Cheap (little resources and little time)
* Fast to build
* Fast to change
* Elements (paper,etc) are reusable
* People are more open and honest to give feedback 
* Tactical and interactive

### Prototyping --  Paper Prototyping (Storyboarding)

In the previous section, you’ve defined the problem and your solution. We will be creating a storyboard (if you previously created a storyboard in the last section, bring it over as it we will be expanding on it). Storyboards are in comic book style fashion and you can add additional squares below or above for text. The customer interviews you conducted in the previous section should be helpful here. You can use one of the “customer stories” as an example for your storyboard. Note: if there are a few different scenarios in which people can encounter your product and you want to test your theory about how users will experience your product feel free to create a few different storyboards as this will assist with user testing. 

Storyboards are in chronological order. Begin by drawing a scenario in which your user is dealing with the problem you have defined. How does the user encounter the problem? Illustrate the issue. Make sure to express the users feelings. Is the user frustrated? Angry? Before finding your solution, how do they attempt to solve the problem? Is there another or a common solution that they attempt but does not solve the problem? Add it to the storyboard. What happens next? How does the user come across your product? What is the first thing that happens when they do? What is the second? Highlight the main interactions between your product and users. How does the user find the solution to their problem via your product? Incorporate what the solution is. What does the user feels once they have solved their problem? Do they feel elated, relief or grateful? Is it all of those things? 

Here’s an example of a storyboard:

![Storyboard Example](http://www.uxforthemasses.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Storyboard-example.jpg "Storyboard example")

This example storyboard is for app called Heartline, which reminds concerned users to check in on a loved one.  Through the illustration and text the problem is clear.  It is not shown how the user came across Heartline but how the user will use the app to solve her dilemma. This storyboard does a great job of displaying how the user sets up the app and the interaction afterwards. Now that you have your storyboard, let’s start creating the prototype for the product itself. 

The source for this example is itself a good read: Austin Centre for Design's [“You’re Not a Great Designer Unless You’re Also a Great Storyteller"](http://www.uxforthemasses.com/storytelling/). In building an MVP from scratch in a small team (or solo!) you'll have to wear a "designer hat" too.  Lots of hats.

### Prototyping --  Creating a Paper Prototype 

 A paper prototype involves designing the product interface on paper. Each interaction will be designed on notecards, construction paper, etc using sharpies, colored markers, post-its, stickers (You can be extremely creative here so have fun with it!). Some tips before getting started: 

Only build what you need (don’t add buttons, etc that users will not need to interact with)
Use text that clearly defines what you need users to do 
Use separate paper for each element

You will be drawing buttons and other elements that your test users will need to see and point to (more on that later) so make sure that your designs are eligible and well defined. I highly recommend you watch this video from Coursera on paper prototyping by course professor Scott Klemmer. Scott walks through storyboarding and creating the prototype. There's a large curated watch/read list at the end of this resource ⬇ but for now here's an [awesome example of paper prototypes](https://youtu.be/y20E3qBmHpg).

You can be really creative with your prototypes so have fun with it!

### Prototyping -- User Testing Paper Prototypes

Once you’ve created your paper prototypes, you want to see how users will interact with what you are building. Similar to customer interviews, in the previous section, you want to recruit 5-10 participants who you would target or use the product. Make sure the tasks you are asking participants to do is realistic. 

Just like in customer interviews, someone will be the pilot and their primary job will be to move the paper as the participants point also this person might need to narrate to the participants. Remember you are not telling the participants what to do, you want to observe what they do/ how they use the product. 

The co-pilot will observe how the participant interacts with the prototype and take notes. When the participants have finished the tasks, take them aside and ask questions about the experience. How was the overall experience using the prototype? Was the prototype intuitive? Make sure to take notes and add notes to whatever you are using to capture them (i.e. Evernote or Google Docs)

Ask people who are not familiar to complete a task with your prototype, this is what’s referred to as user testing. If they succeed, then you know you created the interface if they don’t you are already gathering on what needs to be improved. 


### Prototyping -- Analyzing Paper Prototypes Results

Once you have gathered the results from your user testing and have them in a document. Take a look to find the common denominators. Did all of the participants successfully complete the tasks? Did they do so without confusion? Was there an element in the interaction that did not allow them to complete the task? If so, what was it? If a majority of participants came across the same issue then you will need to work on this issue so it is clear and intuitive for users. Continue to work on your paper prototypes until you are confident enough to move forward with a digital version.

## Digital Prototype

Once you’ve tested your paper prototypes with people. You can move on to create digital prototypes. Digital Prototypes are interactive mockups which showcases all the elements of your product. The mockups are not functional, for i.e., users are not able to make a real purchase. Digital mockups are great because now you can translate the interfaces from the paper prototype to a closer replica of how users will interact with your product. 

There are great platforms such as InVision App that allows you to create great looking mockups easily. Check them out below under Digital Prototype Tools. The platforms are intended to be effortless in use. Each platform has their own tutorials, etc to help you get started so I will not go into those specific details here. Create an account on one of the platforms and start designing your mockup! Your paper prototype will serve as a guide for the functions. The platforms have design templates, images, icons you can use to make an impactful mockup. Try not to get hung up on the look of your prototype,  While using the platforms, test the functions among you and your team (if you have one) for clarity and flow. 

## User Testing Digital Prototypes 

Once you’ve completed your digital mockup, you are ready to test your prototype with users. If you can, go back to your previous users and asks them to complete tasks on the digital version. Still create a scenario in which your users will encounter the need for your product. As with all user testing, have someone who will serve as a co-pilot while you or the other person will be guiding the conversation. Make sure to have the co-pilot take detailed notes on how the users interacts with the prototype while the pilot ask questions regarding certain actions taken. 

With a digital prototype, there are actions which will be intuitive to your users (i.e., logging in) because of familiarity. Because of this, during user testing the user will not be so forthcoming when giving feedback on actions that are habitual. Therefore be direct and specific in your questioning. For instance, if one of your hunches is that the account creation function is too long or cumbersome make sure to have a conversation with the user about this particular function and how it felt for them. Alternatively, if you are working with the same group of users from the paper prototyping user testing, ask them how the experience compared (it’s possible they may not remember). On a side note: do not share your theories/hunches with your users so as not to influence them. 

The feedback on the digital prototype may lean more towards design. Definitely note the feedback and continue to have converse on usability of the product. When you’ve completed the user testing, add the feedback you received to the document you’ve created. Look at the feedback and find commonalities between users. What kind of changes should be made? How does this feedback compared to the ones received for the paper prototypes? Are there any function that are still challenging? Was there a function that was used frequently in the paper version that did not get much attention in the digital version? Why is that? If you find after user testing that there were many challenges, work to solve those issues and conduct another user testing. 


## Native Prototyping 

The last prototype I will go over is Native. Native prototyping involves coding and devices. With native prototyping, you are looking to see how the prototype will work with real life data. Not everyone will need to create a native prototype. Native is useful if you are building a product which uses or interacts with other technology (think Lyft - the rideshare app), the most common ones being camera, speaker and GPS. If your product relies on using on other tech like the ones mentioned then you will highly benefit from native prototyping. 

The coding you do in native prototyping is not final. It’s sole purpose is for you to create a functional version of a prototype for you to test. With native, not everything will be functional and that’s okay. You are merely experimenting and testing. Focus on one or two areas to code for function. The coding should take you a couple of hours. For design, you can use images from the paper prototypes and/or create new ones. 

## User Testing Native Prototypes

Whether you are creating a product for VR headsets or inventing a new Instagram platform, have fun testing with devices. As always, test internally to work out any kinks before letting users test. 

To prepare for user testing of your native prototypes, make sure you have the necessary devices for users available. This doesn’t mean you need to purchase VR headsets for everyone, but if you are working with other hardware you should have one that users can engage with in the test setting (You should have one that you are prototyping with). You want users to fully engage with the functional aspect of your product, whether that is taking a pic, getting directions, using the speakers, etc., confirm that the devices are in good working order and can be used by the users. 

As mentioned previously, you can solicit the user testing group from the previous tests to participate. Decide who will be the pilot and co-pilot on your team and draw up your questions. Create the scenario for the use of your product and now let users know that you would like them to complete an action with your product. Don’t tell them what does or doesn’t function on the product. You want to observe how they interact without your input. Observe, take notes and have a conversation throughout the user testing. 

Once user testing is complete, go to your feedback document and add the new observations and notes. Did any challenges arise? Were there any non-functional buttons/sections that the user felt they needed to complete the action? How did the device uphold during the user testing? Did something slow down? If so, when? Were there issues with the data being used? Look at the feedback you’ve received from the earlier prototypes, were you able to resolve some of the issues that users shared? 

By creating prototypes for your product and run them by real uses you have further validated your idea, designed interface flow and have gathered enough feedback that you can now use to start building your MVP.  Congrats! In the next section, we will continue the breakdown of how to build and launch your MVP, but getting closer to the technical parts that you've been eager to get to!
