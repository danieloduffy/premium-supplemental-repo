# Designing and Launching Your Product Idea

In this series of articles, we'll help you to understand the business development steps you'll need to take to make your product idea not only a reality but a _successful_ one.  These resources are designed to be consumed alongside your technical journey with Premium.  You can complete them at any pace you'd like, but we'd strongly suggest you finish at least an initial read of the entire series (minus the reading lists) before you build any intricate functionality to your MVP.  After all, you don't want to waste time building a product that customers won't want to buy or venture funds won't want to invest in. 

## The Authors

Codecademy not only drew on internal expertise with product development but worked with industry experts in the startup world to bring you the depth and breadth of resources you need to begin your entrepreneurial journey with confidence.  There are a lot of think pieces and noise out there, but we've cut that firehose down to something manageable, linking out with a "reading list" of things we recommend you know.  Importantly, we're not just looking for advice from the one-in-a-million successes like Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg, but stories and experiences that are far more real and relatable.

* Unit 01 was co-written by Priti, who has run a half dozen incubator programs supporting startups between MVP and Series A stages.  She also subsequently spent years working in top-tier venture capital in both sourcing new investments and proactively helping those companies to flourish after raising funds.  From both experiences she met and advised hundreds of founders at a similar stage of product development as the people in Premium, and will kick off this series with a distillation of that advice.
* Unit 02 comes from Catherine, a sometime consultant at one of the Big Four professional services firms.  She not only supported dozens of mid-to-late-stage startups as a consultant but herself went through incubators, accelerators, and founded her own venture-backed startup.  She'll convey what she learned along the way and what you can expect (good and bad) ahead of you.
* Unit 03 and beyond were co-authored by Carmen, who has run multiple brand-name accelerator programs, many of which she built from scratch. These units aim to share the sort of wisdom usually dispensed in such programs.

Together they have decades of startup founding experience from multiple angles to help you to cut through the noise of advice and listicles to get to what you're here for - building your dream.
