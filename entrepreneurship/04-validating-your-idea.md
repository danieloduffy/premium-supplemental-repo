# The Path to Launching Your MVP: Validating Your Idea

As you’ve learned, a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) allows you to know whether what you’ve built is something people want, can be used easily and solves the users problem. When first developing a product idea it can often be confusing as to where to start. So, where do you begin? Before you build your MVP, take the necessary steps to _validate your idea_. You may be absolutely stoked to just focus on coding and making your idea a reality, but before you get too deep into the weeds it's vital to distill your plan and confirm that you're on the right track.  That's where truly understanding your users comes in.

### Identifying Your Problem Set

Begin validating your idea by being clear on the problem your product is solving. Your product should be solving a problem (perhaps it solves multiple problems). The best way to start is to write it down (so simple, right?). You can start by answering the questions below. Keep your answers precise and within 1 to 4 sentences. 

>* _*Who is your customer?*_
>
>* _*What goals do your customers have and what are the major problems that they face reaching that goal?*_
>
>* _*What is the particular customer goal and associated problem(s) that your product is solving?*_
>
>* _*Why is it important for your customer to solve this problem?*_
>
>* _*What is your solution to this problem?*_
>
>* _*How will your product solve this problem? (Define the key features of your product)*_

If you had a hard time answering the questions above, I find that talking it out with someone can bring clarity and if you are inclined to, draw out the problem! On notecards, sketch out the scenario similar to a comic book strip and then write out the responses to the questions. Creating a written outline will help you define your problem and bring focus when you start to build. Also, the outline can be used when approaching potential customers as it is a great way to showcase your idea. 

One of the most important questions that can be missed especially early on is the WHY. Think about why building this product is so important to you. Why are you connected to solving this problem? The WHY is your foundation and will bridge you to your potential customers, so take some time to articulate it. To quote one of my favorite authors, Simon Sinek, “People don’t buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it”. The lean canvas (see reading list) is a great way to express this foundation in a concise manner on which you can iterate.

### Beginning the Interview Process

The next step in validating your idea is doing customer interviews. Interviews are great because they get you to the truth about your product in the real world from potential customers. Also, it allows you to create relationships with potential customers and when your MVP is ready, you have a group of people who you can go back to for testing and feedback. 

To begin the customer interview process, write down your assumptions about the problem and the customers you are targeting, for example, when you think they would use the product, etc. You will be comparing your assumptions to the data that you will be gathering from the interviews to determine if you are on the right track. When you have your assumptions, formulate the questions you will ask to determine if you are correct about your assumptions. Some questions to ask are, would [description of your product] solve your problem? Would you pay for this product? You can view a list of questions here under product validation. As you interview and find more info, continually reflect on what that means for your business idea.

### Finding Your Interviewees

In selecting interviewees, avoid friends and family. It makes sense that they would be your go-to but in my experience they can be really biased, they will be subconsciously inclined to give you the answers they think you want, and will not be able to provide the feedback you need to make a great product. The interviewees you are seeking, are the ones who will have a need for your product _and will buy it_ (a.k.a your target customers). After all, if you want to make a successful business, you'll need to appeal to people who aren't your friends or family! This is also important for business ideas where you would consider yourself a potential customer – you should make sure you aren't the only one who experiences those problems and may need your solution. To find your interviewees, go to your network (you can ask friends and family for referrals), let them know what you are doing and the type of people you are looking to speak with. Try to interview between 10 to 20 people. If you are targeting businesses, make a list and go in person to see if someone will speak with you. 

### Interview Strategy

For the interview process, aim for ten minute interviews per person (try to be efficient with people’s time). Conduct the interviews on video using Zoom or Skype and ask for permission to record the session so you can refer back to it. Always begin the interview by thanking them for their time. Remember that your initial interviews should be focused on clarifying the problem, not pitching your solution. 

I've often found it helpful to take problem interviews with a co-pilot, someone to focus more on listening to the conversation  between the main interviewer and interviewee rather than asking a lot of questions themselves – after all, it can be very easy to get caught up in the process and miss a vital insight.  Typically the pilot will stay somewhat more to the "script" of questions you definitely want to get to whereas the co-pilot will focus on identifying follow up questions or things to drill into further, but feel free to go with whatever dynamic works for you. In any scenario, use the interview for its strengths – it should be a _conversation_, not pure Q&A, and the latter is often better covered in surveys.

### Structuring the Interviews

Resources like the ones I list with each entry in these series should be taken as advice, not a strict rulebook, so don't be afraid to customize your approach somewhat.  I've found that these interviews work best in three distinct waves.  You can confidently move from one wave to the next once you have such a good sense of the likely responses that you can almost predict what people are going to say and when you feel diminishing returns where you aren't learning new things in each new interview.  After you've identified a clear goal people want to reach (e.g. learning to code!) you can drill into the following in order: 

1. *Listening-focused problems interview*.  Ask your audience about their goal _and what problems they have reaching it_.  Don't prompt them with what you think their biggest problems are, listen to what comes to mind for them.  If you have a valuable enough problem to solve, it'll be the one that comes to mind for them and where they are already trying to find solutions but are either finding none or none that quite work (that's your opportunity!).  If they don't mention the problem you think they have top of mind, feel free to ask them if they have the problem you're trying to solve, but let them talk about it.

2. *Prompted-problem interview*.  If you've heard enough people bring up the problem you're trying to solve as one of their bigger obstacles, feel free to prompt newer interviewees to talk about _that_ problem and their attempted solutions to it in more depth and nuance, thus skipping over other problems you aren't looking to solve. The most interviewees should be in this category.

3. *Solution-infused problem interview*.  Whereas in previous steps you've kept your product idea details to an absolute minimum, just a few moments at the end of the call, this time you can open up a bit more to spending about half the time on your intended solution and what works or does not. Only come to this step once you feel you truly understand the problem you're trying to solve, and that you are becoming more confident in your proposed solution. The least interviewees should be in this category, in part because you'll have a dedicated _solution interview_ later when you have a product ready to demo.

### Digesting the Results

When you are done with each interview, place your notes in a tool like Evernote or Google Docs. At the end of all your interviews, compare the responses to your assumptions - this should be an exciting process of discovery! Were there any surprises? Are there any changes you should make to your product? Did the interviewees express a need for the sorts of solutions that your product provides? Was there a subset of interviewees who had or did not have a particular problem or where it was a bigger deal for them? Did you feel like you truly understand your users' problems and how they are going about trying to solve them already? Did you get a positive response from your described solution? If so you have likely _validated your idea_. Congratulations!

With your idea now validated, you can start to work on building out your product! You're already learning the technical skills you need to accomplish this as part of Premium, but guidance from a startup _business_ perspective on that will come in the next section.

## Reading List

The following will help you to get a bit deeper with these topics and help you put it all into practice.

* _Running Lean_ by Ash Maurya.  The free [45 page excerpt](https://leanstack.com/Running_Lean_Excerpt.pdf) is enough to get you started, but strongly consider buying the book itself and using it as a guide.
 * An important tool here is using the lean canvas, which you can create and share on [Canvizer](https://canvanizer.com/new/lean-canvas) for free.
* Techstars' trilogy of videos on running effective customer interviews are full of info.  Learn [who to interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0kiZocBbO8), [what to ask them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTkP2JDeGWM), and how to [interpret the results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz3OA4B6hp8). The host of this video series has [more guidance](https://customerdevlabs.com/2013/11/05/how-i-interview-customers/) on this topic and even an interview script generator, but in my experience it's better to consider the auto-script as an overly long first draft rather than something to rigidly follow.
 * Ash Maurya has a good [article](https://blog.leanstack.com/the-updated-problem-interview-script-and-a-new-canvas-1e43ff267a5d) for writing your interview script _and_ using the customer forces canvas, in an update to his book.
 * Consider writing your problem interview notes on a [customer forces canvas](https://leanstack.com/customer-forces-canvas.pdf) directly instead of taking lots of notes. If you're recording, you shouldn't be taking many notes unless they'll help you in conversation
