# A Practical Guide to Launching Your MVP

Welcome! This is a new series on how to build and launch a Minimum Viable Product (or MVP for short). In this series, I will cover how you can develop your MVP by walking you through each stage of the process and along the way I will breakdown terminology and share stories from founders who have done it. 

First of all, congrats on beginning this new path. Building a product is not easy. Despite the inundation of startup success stories in the media, the reality is, _entrepreneurship is hard_. However, the hardships can be mitigated by being organized, moving quickly through failures, and building a supportive community. The early days can and should be creative, experimental, fun and does not have to be lonely. As part of Codecademy, you already have an advantage that most founders I’ve met wished for during their early days so I encourage you to continue to deepen your connections with your fellow students and to be a resource for each other.

As for me, I'm Carmen - I am an Ecosystem Builder with a passion for startups, technology, inclusion and knowledge-sharing. I’ve worked both within startups and in startuip program development specifically for founders in the early stages of their businesses. Through this, I’ve reviewed hundreds of businesses (and business ideas) and have provided guidance to founders in various industries from when they are nowhere near ready to apply to an accelerator through to post-graduation. My goal in this series is to make the process less daunting and more importantly get your product where it needs to be for whatever comes after. After seeing so many founders go through this process, I hope I can help you avoid some common pain points.

There are an abundance of articles, books, videos, etc, on the topic of MVP (of course, I’ll be sharing some of those with you), however, building an MVP or startup is not an exact science. There will be examples and tools that are not applicable to what you are building and that’s fine (I will try my best to provide a variety of options). You should be using this series as a guideline on how you can you develop your product, not a strict manual.

## Underlining the "M" in MVP

Recalling Eric Reis' _Lean Startup Method_ that you learned about in section 1, we know that with an MVP we should aim to shorten the product development timeline as much as possible to quickly determine if a proposed business idea will work. This 'validated learning' allows for you to learn about what your customers want while also permitting you to make changes with agility.  Get the product to your users as quickly and learn even faster.

It is critical to underline that with MVP development should involve minimal effort. That doesn't mean laziness, but development should be cost effective in terms of time and money. The thing just needs to do the minimum to solve a problem.

This series of articles will lead you through the business side of building your MVP, what to do once you are ready for launch, as well best practices during and post launch.

I am excited to take this journey with you and help you avoid the traps so many founders have fallen into before you, so let’s do this! 

## Resource List

Eric Reis' [40 minute lecture](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html) (or less if you increase playback speed) on MVPs is _highly_ recommended. Many people also read his book, which is a cornerstone of many other resources on modern tech entrepreneurship.
