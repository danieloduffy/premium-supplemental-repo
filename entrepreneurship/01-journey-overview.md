# Steps to Take and Pitfalls to Avoid While Turning Your Idea Into a Product

Now that you are acquiring and honing the technical skills required to build a tech product, you may be considering building a company to monetize said product. How we think about building a product and how we think about building a company are quite different, and require different skills and priorities. In this part of the curriculum, we will cover crucial and often overlooked aspects of the most important time in early-stage entrepreneurship: _product-market fit_ and how to think about _minimum viable product_. 

## Part One: What do we mean by product-market fit? 

One of the first hurdles you face as an inventor and builder of a tech product is ensuring that you have identified a real problem and a working solution _that people will pay to use_. If you’re building something to give away for free and don’t mind if it ends up just being used by yourself and your close friends, that’s great! Product-market fit is likely not going to be a big deal for you. However, if you’re excited about solving a problem with technology and monetizing that solution, or even just acquiring a lot of users, _product-market fit_ is of the utmost importance. 

You may be asking yourself, “Why do I need to think about the market? I just want to build a product already!” Or perhaps you are thinking, “I know my product has a market! This is something I know the world needs, and I already know a ton of people will want to use it and pay me for the privilege to do so.” This is a trap that many first-time entrepreneurs fall into when enthusiasm for their ideas overpowers the realities of building a product that will attract a lot of users and that can support a business.  Your own enthusiasm for your idea is valuable and will help motivate you to build something great. However, you need to be careful to fully understand how others - meaning, everyone apart from yourself - will view and use your product. It can be so exciting to dive deeply into the technical intricacies of designing and building a tech product that many people neglect to conduct the necessary research into what their intended users want and need. It is, in a way, easier to work obsessively on building out a full, or close to full, version of your vision than to test it on actual people during the build phase.

Fortunately, there is a clear way to avoid this trap; be thoughtful in identifying the problem you are trying to solve for, talk to your users early and often, and test your product during the build phase!  

How do you do that? Start with the problem itself.

### Is it a problem in need of a solution, or a solution in search of a problem?

This is a tricky question. Many entrepreneurs have often heard the advice to find a personal problem, something that they are passionate about, and build a solution. For example, if you worked in restaurants and were responsible for ordering supplies, and found it to be a cumbersome and outdated process, your first thought might be to build a tech product that solves for restaurant ordering (there are companies that now do this!). Perhaps instead you are a music connoisseur, and have always wanted an app that would give you recommendations for new bands and upcoming concerts. It is a common practice to build something that affects you personally, and in many ways it makes sense - if you are a part of the demographic that you hope to serve, you will already have some insight into that demo’s likes and needs. However, it is incredibly important to think through your idea and make sure that your product is something that solves a problem that your target customer desperately wants to solve, in a way that they will actually use. Now, if you’re designing a game or other form of entertainment, or are building something for your own personal use, this will not really be as much an issue for you. But if you are building something that you want other people to use, this is a critical first step.  It is what is often referred to as “_problem space_ versus _solution space_.” 

Let's define our terms. An often-cited example of this can be found in the history of one of America’s most innovative government agencies - NASA. During the 1960’s, when the American space program found itself in a heated, intensely competitive “space race” with Russia (then called the Soviet Union), NASA contractors spent millions of dollars developing a space pen for American astronauts to use aboard spacecraft. The space pen has a pressurized cartridge and ingenious design that allows it to write upside down, in zero gravity, and in extreme temperatures, which are all situations that the original user (an American astronaut) would find themselves to be in while in outer space. It can even write underwater. It is a beautifully designed instrument that took much time, care, and money to make. 

Soviet astronauts used a pencil.

Like NASA, you want to build something necessary to solve a pressing problem. Also like NASA, you have had (and will have) many other intelligent and successful ideas, so don’t be discouraged. But do subject all of your endeavors to this rigorous standard. Having a space pen is nice, though costly. If you were making them to sell just to people who could and want to spend that much money on a luxury item, it may be worthwhile to do. However, if the vast majority of your intended customers would rather just use a pencil, you will need to rethink your approach. 

This is also a great time to ask yourself - “Can or should this problem be solved using technology?” If you’re excited to use your new coding skills, you should put them to work on a project that is well-suited to a technology-based solution. If, like the NASA example above, a technology-based solution isn’t necessarily the best approach, you can save yourself time and find a project more suited to what you would like to work on.

Ask yourself: If I concisely pitched this idea to a person who exactly fits the description of my target customer, would their immediate response be “Take my money, I need that right now?” If so, you’re on the right track - you’ve achieved the “fit” of product-market fit. If the person’s answer is “Doesn’t [this other product] accomplish the same thing?” then you should listen carefully to why he or she believes something else achieves the same objective. It will be helpful user research for you. Which leads us to...

### Identify your target market

The ‘target market” for a product is a cross-section of the population that has the problem you have identified and will actively use your product. In today’s world, it can be very tempting (and very common) to identify the target market of a product as everyone, or nearly everyone. There are several reasons for this; the one that we want to focus on today is the one related to future capital. Even in the idea phase, many entrepreneurs are already thinking of a future in which they will seek capital from investors, and are already formulating their pitch to said investors, whether they be angel investors, accelerators, venture capitalists, corporate funds, or other forms of institutional investments. It is an appealing prospect to investors to think that the market potential for a product is everyone! However, this line of thinking can lead a promising entrepreneur astray as they focus on building something that they think an investor would want to fund, rather than building something that customers want to use.  Remember that ultimately _your customers_ are your focus. Products with traction already have a leg up in raising capital. In this context, “traction” refers to a measurable set of customers of your product. It is driven by interest in and consistent usage of the product in a way that can be quantified numerically, and is ideally tied to revenue. But before we can get to dreams of revenue, let’s get back to the idea of traction with your target market.

In order to thoughtfully design and build something that has traction, you must have a clear idea of a *specific* group of people who will actively use your product. Even wildly successful products that were eventually used by almost everyone started with a specific target market in mind.  You may be thinking, “Surely everyone goes to restaurants, and thus everyone will want to use my restaurant app!” Perhaps some day everyone who eats out will use your restaurant app, but the entire market - or even a segment of a big market - is a big target to go after, and when you're starting off it's better to take things step-by-step. In the early stages, it is important to identify and focus on which subset of a market are likely to use your app early and often, and what features said power users need most. It is, as the adage goes, impossible to please everyone all of the time. It is possible to really study a specific group that you want to serve, figure out what they need, and deliver it in a useful and well-designed way. Making your early users (also called early adopters) extremely happy with your product, to the point that they use it regularly and recommend to others, should be your goal.

### Step-By-Step

This time, let’s look at Facebook as an example. Facebook routinely asserts that one out of every twelve people in the world have a Facebook account. With such a wide, global reach, Facebook is undoubtedly one of the most popular tech products in use today, with a user base any company might envy. But Facebook did not get to where it is by trying to please everyone from the beginning, or even by planning to build something that everyone would use. Facebook was originally built by Mark Zuckerberg for the target audience of his own friends at Harvard University (a group that he knew and understood well). It was then adapted to be used exclusively by students at Harvard University. After becoming popular with students at Harvard, it was materially improved and expanded to include students at other Ivy League universities. After Facebook excelled in that market, it expanded to college students nationwide, young people around the world, businesses, and so on until it achieved its current global reach. Along the way, the company continually measured user activity and used that information to develop new features and quietly remove unpopular ones. 

Ask yourself: For whom am I building this product? Be as detailed as you can about your potential users - their chosen industry/career, age, daily habits, income level, geographic area, interests, existing affiliations or communities, and/or anything else that pertains to your product. You can then build out one or multiple profiles of your target customers, which will help enormously in your research and product design process. For example: one of the target user profiles for our imaginary restaurant app could be *tech professionals between the ages of 25-40 who live in New York, San Francisco, Chicago, or Los Angeles and eat out in mid- to high-level restaurants at least twice a week.* The specificity may scare you at first, but remember that if you can design something that works exceptionally well for this profile and get that demographic to pay to use it regularly, you’re gaining traction and are well on your way to building a successful product. 


## Part Two: Talking to your users and testing your MVP

Okay, so you’ve found a problem in need of a solution and have thought hard about your target user profiles and are on board with talking to your future customers! How you choose to communicate with them can vary based on how that target user chooses to communicate and where they gather; for example, in your profile work, you may have identified a demographic that prefers texting to email, or phone calls to email, or in-person conversations to texting. In your reading list, you will find resources to help you think through the types of questions to ask and even how to deal with the silent bits of the conversation. It’s highly recommended that you consult those resources before writing out your questions for your users, as the questions will be very specific to your target user and to your specific product. 

There are a few general concepts around talking to your users that apply in most situations. Firstly, there are two major time frames to consider in this process: *before* you build, or write a single line of code, and *during* the build, which encompasses everything from the first line of code to when your product is absolutely totally perfect and will never need any new features or debugs or anything, ever. So, everyone stays in the during phase for some time. 

*Before you build:* As mentioned above, it is very tempting to have a great idea and immediately start writing code and building a minimum viable product (MVP). A minimum viable product is commonly defined as developing sufficient enough of a website or product to satisfy early users, with a plan of a final and complete set of features to be released after incorporating early user feedback. And while that may sound like talking to your customers, it’s crucial to get that process started before building your MVP.

Careful research into your target market will not only give you a better sense of what to build, but will also likely change your initial ideas of what your product will look like. This is excellent, since that means you will build something effective and that you will not waste time rebuilding something that you have changed your mind about. 

You may have heard the Build/Measure/Learn loop, which was popularized by the book *The Lean Startup*, by Eric Ries. The Build/Measure/Learn loop can be a useful tool in iterating a good idea, but is not always the best initial step for a first-time builder.  Our example in this section will come from a process outlined by Ash Maurya, author of Lean Stack. In the quote below, a fictional co-founder named Mary offers excellent advice to a friend who is trying to gain traction on a product he started building without talking to customers first:

>“We didn’t start with building an MVP in our startup, but an offer. We first sketched out several variants of our idea on a Lean Canvas which helped us identify and home in several promising customer-problem-solution possibilities. **We then set up some two dozen customer interviews to validate our customer and problem assumptions.** Once we did that, defining the solution was a piece of cake. But even then, we didn’t rush to build out an MVP. We built a demo instead and assembled an offer that we delivered to prospects over many more interviews. Only when we got enough customers to buy into our offer, did we start building out the MVP. What we eventually built looked very different from what we thought we’d build.” (boldface ours)

While this is a fictional process, it is very similar to the one that many successful founders have used to build profitable companies. Note the boldface section on customer interviews. Your customers will give you the solution they need. 

Since you have already created your customer profiles, it is time to communicate with people who fit that profile. Founders have located and talked with target users in numerous ways; some entertainment app designers engaged with users on gaming forums, business-to-business websites engaged with people in professional associations relevant to their product, founders have reached out to their friends and friends of friends to gather information about their patterns of behavior. They key is conversation, not passive reading or absorption. It’s important to observe behavior and ask questions. After you have listened carefully and have thoughtfully incorporated your research into your design, you can start to build.

*During the build:* It surprises many first-time builders and founders to learn that you do not need to build out your entire product - or even a working MVP - in order to test it. There any many low-cost ways to test your hypotheses about a problem and your product/solution, and even to test the product’s design and user experience, with tools as simple as pen and paper. It may sound a little ridiculous to draw the wire frame or work flow of your website or app for people, but it is quite effective. Prototyping tools such as InVision, Sketch, or Balsamiq, and wireframe tools like Framebox or iPhone Mockup (as the name suggests, it is specifically for iPhone apps) can help you figure out not only the user experience, but can also allow you to test and get feedback on the entire website or app from potential users. You can ask users if the design is intuitive, where they are expecting each link to take them, and similar questions before you’ve actually built the product. 

Why is getting this feedback through a prototype more valuable than just building it and testing it? Apart from saving time, and money, it addresses a specific issue.  If you launch your product without this research, the purpose and design of the product rely on several of your own assumptions: about the problem, the solution, the user experience, the value proposition of the product, and retention. When people start to use your product, you won’t know why. When people stop using your product, you won’t know why. You will have a much harder time trying to pinpoint which part of the product needs an adjustment. By identifying and communicating regularly with your users, you can build better, measure more accurately, and learn more quickly. 

And *then* you can create your own product, having avoided the common pitfalls that plague first time founders.
