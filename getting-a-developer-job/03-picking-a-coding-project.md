# Picking A Coding Project
Now that you are ready to apply your skills to a coding project, you may be overwhelmed by the sheer number of potential projects you’d like to attempt first. Alternately, you may feel stuck in thinking of even one, or worried about which is the *best* one to work on first. This is a common concern for learners on Codecademy, exacerbated in Premium by the centrality of the custom project, so we have collected a list of potential ideas and outlined an approach on how to think about your work.  In any case, we're here to get you out of [tutorial hell](https://dev.to/beznet/a-definitive-guide-for-escaping-tutorial-hell-102c).

*If you are working on a pet project:* this is a great motivation for getting started with coding.  However, it can rapidly drag you down as you realize over time the sheer extent of the gap between your vision and what you want to achieve, or become disillusioned by how poorly things work and look when you're just getting started.  That's why we'd recommend that you take the pressure off when you're starting, by making something with near-identical functionality and designs but that is ostensibly _not_ your dream project.  Build "Zocdoc for cat therapists" or "Etsy for custom beanie babies," something funny that you won't mind getting wrong but where you can simply tweak the copy and it transforms into your real thing.  Coding is frustrating enough without adding on top working on a project that you don't enjoy, so just remember that - pick something you'll _have fun_ making.

*If this is your first project:* remember that this is a practice project and its primary purpose is to help you develop your skills in writing code, debugging, design, and deploying your project. It’s helpful to select one that is a good fit for whichever coding language you have chosen to study, but apart from that, we recommend that you focus on an achievable project that you can use to learn. 
 
*If you’re trying to level up your coding skills:* try to pick something that allows you to build a specific skill - a new language, your design ability, etc. - or that tackles whatever was most difficult about your first project.

*If you're unsure what to do even after reading this:* don't sweat it.  You can always do a smaller project to get going, like an "about me" portfolio site, and discuss over time with your mentor about what else to do.  If you can pick a project that you'll particularly enjoy, all the better, but don't delay yourself trying to find something ideal.
 
## Ideas to start you off
 
If you’d like to start with a short, doable project, take a look at these concise list of beginner projects:

Another option that will likely come later in your journey is to contribute to an ongoing open source project, which you can learn more about here:

## Planning your project
Once you select your project, you will want to plan out how to approach it. This planning phase will be enormously helpful to you as you go along. Think of it like writing an outline for an essay before you write the actual essay. Plan out your code by using your algorithmic thinking skills and breaking down each part of your program into specific functions, and then write the code for each of those functions. Take a look at this sample plan from Code Conquest: 
 
“For example, a translation game would require the following functions:
a function to add a word and its translation to their respective arrays
a function to call function 1 on each word
a function to load a word onto the screen
a function to fire when the user’s input is correct
a function to fire when the user’s input is incorrect
a function to determine whether to fire function 4 or function 5”
Then, you can write each function separately and better schedule how long it will take to write the entire program.

## In conclusion
You have gotten far enough in your studies to build something, which means you absolutely have the dedication and patience to plan out and build your first project. Remember, this can be fun! Try a few different ideas and see what you enjoy the most. Happy coding!
