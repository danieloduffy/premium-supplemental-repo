# Your First Job As a Programmer

Congratulations! You have secured your first job as a programmer (or maybe you're reading this in anticipation and prep for getting your job, in which case congrats in advance and good on you for being diligent). If this is your first job ever, you are likely wondering what working life will entail. If you’ve worked in other professional environments and have made a career switch to software engineering, you may be wondering how this role and environment will be different from your previous jobs. 

We have outlined some general advice and tips below. You can also look at anecdotal accounts of people’s first day as programmers or software engineers here:

This is an overview of how pushing your own personal code differs from contributing to larger projects in your new role as a team member.


## Learn as much as you can about the company, tools, and culture
No one will expect you to know how to to the entirety of your new job right out of the gate, but your team and your manager will likely expect you to be familiar with the company and its product or service. Ideally, you should also familiarize yourself with the company’s customers and competitors. 

All engineering interviews include an assessment of your technical skills, which will have given you some insight into which programming language and tools your new company uses. You can also ask about which tools your future department uses during the interview process or in the time between signing your offer letter and commencing work. If it’s a tool you’re unfamiliar with, doing a little research on how it works can go a long way towards helping you feel more comfortable your first week on the job.

This is a first person account of the first week of work, including insight into understanding your team and who to ask for what. Amy talks through the things she learned (feel free to use subtitles if the background music is distracting!)

## Understand how your team works

Does your new team work in sprints?  Use Kanban?  You should have learned about some of these terms from our series on how dev teams work (or if not, go do that!).  Familiarizing yourself with the working dynamics and systems of your new team will be instrumental in getting adjusted quickly, because coding is rarely a solo sport.

## Understand how your team communicates, and how to ask questions

The importance of *communicating well with your team* is also covered in other modules, but is important to mention again here because of how crucial it is to your success at and enjoyment of your new programming job.

A great post on this part of the acclimation process, with a few tips on what to observe about your new team and the company culture. 

And hey! Maybe you’re working remotely! That makes communication with your team *even more important.*

Here, a number of remote developers answer questions about working remotely, and offer good insight into what they wish they knew when they first started (and how to start off on the right foot).

## Be patient
Always remember that you have accomplished something difficult - you have taught yourself a new skill and landed a job in that field. It is possible that you want to dive right in and start working on big projects right away, but remember that most junior developers are given small projects to begin with, and they are given those projects for a reason. Your first day, week, and month on the job are opportunities for you to learn as much as possible and to build a strong foundation for your future projects. To help with perspective, here are two accounts of the first full month of a new engineering role.

## In conclusion
Landing that first programming job is exciting, and probably a bit nerve-wracking as well. You are starting what will hopefully be a long and rewarding career with a great deal of room for learning, professional advancement, and expanding your network. Do your best, and when you get stuck, be sure to look at our module on what to do when you need help.
