# Getting a Job with Your New Technical Skills

Before we go into the many sub-topics and steps ahead of you in getting a new job, let's start you off with a primer, starting with a quick YouTube video.

With being in the Premium "personal trainer" system, we can and will help you to learn all the technical skills you'll need to get a new job, but we'd like you to be an active, informed participant in your own journey.  This set of resources will help you to put your journey into perspective.

## How Long It Will Take

Not everyone in this program is aiming for the same outcome, they starting at the same place, or even learning the same subjects, but all of you should be ready for the long haul.

For a general answer, some quick maths show that you won't become job-ready overnight.  When looking at the amount of time bootcamp students put in to get "job ready" - 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, for 90 days... plus homework, pre-work, and post-work - it is only realistic to say that it will take many months to cover that amount of material outside of a bootcamp structure.  Even if you're learning full-time, you are unlikely to be able to set the same pace you would do in a program designed for that purpose.

For a more detailed take on this question, watch a [quick video](https://youtu.be/sKJMxikItYg) on the subject.  There is no one answer for you all - talk with your mentor about your current skills gap versus your objective, they can help you to plan out your path over time.

## What Bootcamps Do (and Don't) Teach

Many of us here at Codecademy are bootcamp graduates, others worked at bootcamp programs.  As of Q1 2020, 50% of the Premium team itself comes from one of those two backgrounds, so we are very familiar with them!  There are a few big points we want you to know early on enough so that you know what extra skills to develop to put you ahead of the curve. 

### Bootcamps Don't Get You Truly "Job Ready"

Getting a job result doesn't always mean getting a full-time tech job as part of a team (many bootcamp "placement rates" are defined more broadly to include any paying job over a certain dollar figure) but a salaried coding job is what most bootcamp participants are aiming for.  The fact is, even the brightest graduates from the best bootcamp programs find themselves immediately able to slot in at a tech company upon graduation.  Rather, bootcamps produce people who have shown that they have a base level of technical aptitude to show that they are trainable.  Recruiting teams know that bootcamp graduates will need far longer to be productive than anyone with prior work experience, but that the company can save tens of thousands of dollars helping to fill the gap.  Your goal is not to show that you are as good as someone with prior work experience, but that you are talented and dedicated enough to be worth the extra training time and whatever they'd pay you.

### The Biggest Gaps Between Bootcamp and Job

Traditional time-limited bootcamps need to crank out as many graduates as possible, as fast as they can, with the minimum they need to impress an employer.  Bootcamps find it very difficult to do two things within their time constraints:

1. How to write *high quality code*, not just to build things that work or to have memorized syntax.  This is something best unearthed by _code review_ and _consistent feedback_.  You can get this from your mentor and your peers.
2. How to *collaborate with code*.  Programming, data science, game development... no matter the domain, coding is seldom done solo.  You'll need to learn not only how to work well with other coders (soft skills!) but the processes and nuances involved in being part of a team.  That means code bases, legacy code, team projects, sprints, pointing, pair-programming, and many more pieces of jargon that you don't need to know yet but will.  You can get some of this with your mentor but most of this will come from working with your peers.  This is why it's vital to play an active part in the Slack community, e.g. to not only ask answers but answer them, to work on a group project, in order to build these skills.

Depending on the post-graduate resources offered in a bootcamp, graduates will often be relatively unpracticed at passing developer job interviews.

It's not just bootcamps - these are things that self-taught learners are either unaware of or ignore in favor of spending every spare moment learning more syntax or building bigger portfolios.  Even freelancers will often need to collaborate on projects or iterate on the work of others - it is indeed relatively rare to build anything truly "from scratch" as a paid professional.  Now that you know this, don't forget or ignore it!

If you stick with Premium, we'll cover the parts most bootcamps don't teach. We'll review your code to get it production-level, help you to practice code collaboration and even team projects with the Premium community, and give you interview practice.

## We're Here to Help

Throughout this series and with this program, we'll help you not only with the things bootcamps teach you, but the things they don't.  We've got your back.  Stay tuned, work hard, collaborate with your peers, and trust your mentor.
