# Building Your Portfolio

Without work experience as a developer, a solid portfolio of projects you’ve built is the most effective way to showcase your skills and prove what you’re capable of to a potential employer.  In Codecademy Premium, you'll start working on your portfolio items from day one of the program, so we want you to know a bit more about what and why early.

Below we’re sharing resources on what should go on your portfolio website, how to build one, what employers are looking for when you’ve never had a job as a developer, and more. Note that some resources below may be aimed toward specific career tracks like web or game development, but we chose them because we think they are useful for all of you. But first, a big-picture overview.

## What’s a development portfolio?
A development portfolio showcases notable projects a developer has built or contributed to, oftentimes with screenshots of the project and a detailed description of what those contributions entailed. The video and article below provide overviews of what a typical web development portfolio looks like—there’s a fair bit of overlap in their content, so feel free to choose one.

## Why is my portfolio so important?
Resumes are a ubiquitous part of every professional field, and you’ve probably made one before. They’re good at describing your skills and experiences along two dimensions—what you’ve done and how long you’ve done it for. On the other hand, a portfolio website can represent you and your capabilities as a vivid, three-dimensional portrait.

You can describe the inspiration for a project, the process of building something collaboratively, unexpected challenges, or anything else that seems relevant. Just remember: recruiters are busy people, so just because you *can* include some information doesn’t mean you *should*.

## What should go in my portfolio?
Before you start thinking about the sorts of projects you might want to build and include in your portfolio, heed this advice: when in doubt, just start coding. 

Your portfolio is, first and foremost, a testament to your ability to build things, and at this stage, any project you complete will be a valuable learning experience. Any project that seems fun and interesting to you is one you’re more likely to complete, and that’s all the reason you need to get started.

We’ve had members of the Premium community make a virtual ant farm, a Star Wars plot generator, and more. There may come a time fret about the technologies you use or how directly your projects map to a job function, but we promise that time is not now.

## How should I create my portfolio?
Once you’ve built a few projects for your portfolio, it’s time to focus on building the actual website. For simplicity, we can break down your options into two categories. 

“WYSIWYG” (*what you see is what you get*) editors allow you to build your portfolio website with an intuitive, drag-and-drop interface. They make the process of building your site quick and easy, but the limitations they place on customization can be frustrating, and the fully-featured versions will cost you a subscription fee.

On the other hand, you can build your website from scratch. The process is naturally more complex and time-consuming, but doing so gives you yet another opportunity to showcase your skills. In other words, your portfolio website itself can be a testament to your skills. On top of that, you’ll be surprised by how many unexpected web development lessons you’ll learn while creating a real, working website.

## How polished should my portfolio be?
Because you don’t have work experience as a professional developer to lean on, giving your portfolio a polished and professional look can go a long way, especially if you’ve built it with a WYSIWYG editor. All of the text should be error-free (when in doubt, trust [Grammarly](grammarly.com)), and the design doesn’t have to be anything fancy if you aren't trying to be a designer, but it shouldn’t look like an afterthought.

However, much like our advice about choosing which projects to build, a live site that’s a bit rough around the edges is always preferable to one that’s “still in the works.” The article below shares some shortcuts that will help you give your site a polished, professional look with a minimal time investment.

## In conclusion
Your portfolio is a chance to show your skills and personality, so a recruiter who visits it can leave with a much better sense of who you are and what you can do. The projects showcased, the way the website is built, and what it looks like are completely up to you, but no matter what, it should feel like *you*.
